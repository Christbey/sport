KinderMath® Curriculum is a Kindergarten Math Curriculum set of 15 units and are teacher created, kid-tested, and most importantly kid-approved! KinderMath® curriculum takes away that monotonous way of teaching math where students sit and listen to the teacher TEACH math. Instead, KinderMath® encourages guidance from the teacher while the students TEACH and LEARN math through hands-on and engaging math activities with their partners. KinderMath® units are made up of 10 instructional days in each unit but can be adjusted to fit your classroom needs. The units include a pre and post test as a way to ensure student growth over the unit. KinderMath units also SPIRAL learning constantly! They do not teach the concept and then leave it behind. We will continue to review those previously taught skills! These are just a few highlights you’ll see using the KinderMath Units; kids talking about math, kids using manipulatives, activities that are fun + engaging, learning that requires critical thinking!KinderMath curriculum is a 35 week math curriculum that includes lesson plans that break down a 60 minute block math time into these sections {whole-group number sense, collaborative number sense aka pair work, whole-group fluency, whole-group math lesson, collaborate lesson follow-up aka pair work, and independent practice aka worksheet}. The units will also include any and all cards needed to make the lessons successful! You will just need to provide the manipulatives like teddy bears or snap cubes!KinderMath is a simple print and teach math curriculum. No more tracking down ideas, worksheets, cards, etc! I have it covered! What is included in KinderMath?Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose to do so.

""My district uses a math program that quite frankly stinks! I have been struggling for three years to teach math in a way that makes sense and truly reaches my students. I know it is so important for them to have those foundational skills for the future so I would always stress and wish I had more guidance. This has been a LIFE SAVER. I cannot say enough about how well thought out these lessons are and how much SENSE they make. It is so nice to have piece of mind to know that my students are truly mastering concepts rather than jumping around to different objectives daily. Thank you for your amazing work, Tara!

If you teach to a varying set of standards, you can email me for assistance. Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

"FirstieMath® First Grade Math Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work","FirstieMath® Intervention: A 30 week comprehensive and systematic math intervention curriculum. What is FirstieMath™ Intervention? FirstieMath® Intervention is a very versatile math intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, whole-group math, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in",https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/FirstieMath-Intervention-Curriculum-3220934-1726436502/original-3220934-1.jpg,https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FirstieMath-First-Grade-Math-Intervention-Curriculum-3220934,"FirstieMath® Intervention: A 30 week comprehensive and systematic math intervention curriculum. What is FirstieMath™ Intervention? FirstieMath® Intervention is a very versatile math intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, whole-group math, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. You will first assess how much time you have for the lesson and then make adjustments.What Does a FirstieMath® Intervention Lesson Look Like? FirstieMath® Intervention is broken down into three major areas; counting warm up, skill focus lesson, and independent practice. For the counting warm up each week the students will follow the same routine. The routines are subitizing counting, conceptual counting, critical-thinking counting, oral counting, and operational counting. For the skill focus lesson the students will follow along as the teacher guides them through the step-by-step lesson. The lesson concludes with an independent practice exit ticket. This can be done during group time or once the students are sent back to their tables. What is included within FirstieMath® Intervention? - 30 weeks of lesson plans- 150 student follow-up practice sheets- All necessary teacher ""cards"" for the lessons- Just add manipulatives to this packet and you're set!How Can FirstieMath® Intervention Look in MY Classroom? Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. You can move the lessons around to fit your math curriculum. If using this unit along with FirstieMath™ the weeks are already aligned and match up to the “master” curriculum. A cautious word on pacing, please realize that this program can be used for intervention, lesson follow up, and enrichment. If using this program for intervention you will pace the lessons slowly and very likely repeat the lessons until students have mastered the skills. If using this program as a whole-group follow up you would most likely follow the pacing of FirstieMath® and use these lessons to rest assure students have mastered the concept. If using this packet in a guided math format to push your advanced students you would advance to the unit or lesson where you feel they would be most successful. FirstieMath® Intervention Scope and Sequence FirstieMath® Intervention is designed for a 150 day curriculum or 30 weeks. Below is a closer look at the scope and sequence of FirstieMath® Intervention. Unit 1 Numbers to 10: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 2 Addition to 10: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 3 Subtraction to 10: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 4 Geometry: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 5 Numbers to 20: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 6 Add and Subtract within 20: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 7 Measurable Attributes: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 8 Graphing: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 9 Numbers to 40: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 10 Add and Subtract within 40: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 11 Math Strategies: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 12 Numbers to 120: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 13 Add and Subtract within 100: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 14 Time and Money: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 15 2nd Grade Prep: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included) I don't own FirstieMath. Can I Still Use This? Of course! FirstieMath follows a scope and sequence that is common in most if not all first grade math classrooms! These lessons are based upon those common skill focuses! I teach Kindergarten. Can I Still Use This? A lot of kindergarten teachers are desperately searching for a way to differentiate in their classrooms for their higher leveled students. This packet does offer 30 weeks of lesson plans and practice sheets! This would be great for a guided math group, support staff member's instruction, and perfect a ""pull back"" group of students.

KinderMath® Intervention is a very versatile math intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, whole-group math, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. You will first assess how much time you have for the lesson and then make adjustments.What Does a KinderMath® Intervention Lesson Look Like? KinderMath® Intervention is broken down into three major areas; counting warm up, skill focus lesson, and independent practice. For the counting warm up each week the students will follow the same routine. The routines are subitizing counting, conceptual counting, critical-thinking counting, oral counting, and operational counting. For the skill focus lesson the students will follow along as the teacher guides them through the step-by-step lesson. The lesson concludes with an independent practice exit ticket. This can be done during group time or once the students are sent back to their tables.How Can KinderMath® Intervention Look in MY Classroom? Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. You can move the lessons around to fit your math curriculum. If using this unit along with KinderMath® the weeks are already aligned and match up to the “master” curriculum. A cautious word on pacing, please realize that this program can be used for intervention, lesson follow up, and enrichment. If using this program for intervention you will pace the lessons slowly and very likely repeat the lessons until students have mastered the skills. If using this program as a whole-group follow up you would most likely follow the pacing of KinderMath® and use these lessons to rest assure students have mastered the concept. If using this packet in a guided math format to push your advanced students you would advance to the unit or lesson where you feel they would be most successful. KinderMath® Intervention Scope and Sequence KinderMath® Intervention is designed for a 150 day curriculum or 30 weeks. Below is a closer look at the scope and sequence of KinderMath® Intervention. Please note that some units receive more/less weeks of instruction depending on the difficulty of the task.Unit One: Numbers 0-5 .....................2 weeks of instructionUnit Two: Sort and Classify.................2 weeks of instructionUnit Three: Numbers to 10.................1 week of instructionUnit Four: Compare Numbers to 10.... 2 weeks of instructionUnit Five: Measurement.....................1 week of instructionUnit Six: Numbers 10-19.....................4 weeks of instructionUnit Seven: 2D and 3D Shapes...........2 weeks of instructionUnit Eight: Numbers to 100.................3 weeks of instruction Unit Nine: Comparing Sets..................2 weeks of instructionUnit Ten: Addition to 10…………......... 2 weeks of instructionUnit Eleven: Add.

ALL OF THE DAY ONE STORIES ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN A GOOGLE SLIDES VERSION ALONG WITH THE PRINTABLES! >>> VIEW A PREVIEW VIDEO OF THE GOOGLE VERSION HERE <<< What is KinderSocialSkills?KinderSocialSkills Curriculum is an engaging social skills curriculum with young learners in mind! KinderSocialSkills takes 75 common social skills and teaches them in a kid-friendly way for students. The students are able to grow and develop by listening to the social stories. The social stories contain two main characters, Tom Cat and Tabby Cat. The two cats will take the students on adventures as they are introduced to the broad social skills context through both home and school settings.Watch a video of the program ** HERE ** What is the structure of KinderSocialSkills?KinderSocialSkills consists of 75 two-day lesson plans. Day one is an introduction of the skill and a social story. Day two is a review of the skill and a hands-on approach to applying the skill. On the second day the students are also asked to deeply think and apply the skill to their own lives. On both days the students will interact with their peers through verbal discussions. The teacher will lead the initial conversation and then turn it over to the students for their opportunity to have collaborative peer discussion. KinderSocialSkills also includes a follow-up independent writing sheet for each skill. This is a way for the students to put the skill on paper and for parents to be connected with the skill of the day. There is a note at the bottom of each paper so parents can track the social skill and hopefully continue the discussion of that skill at home.What is included in KinderSocialSkills?- 150 social skill lessons (75 skills spanning over 2 days each) *day one is a social story and day two is follow-up) - 75 follow-up student sheets (2 differentiated versions included for non-writers and writers)- paper clip art cat ""puppets""- notebook labels- journal coversWhat does the RESEARCH say about KinderSocialSkills?Research shows us social skills are at times a bigger indicator for future success in life than academics (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2015). That statement is profound. A longitudinal study regarding kindergarten students and social skills was conducted by Drs. Damon Jones and Mark Greenberg, both professors at Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Max Crowley, a professor from Duke University. The kindergarten students were tracked over a 20 year period and the results were astonishing. The predictions made in kindergarten based upon their social skills had a direct correlation with outcomes met in mid-adulthood and later adulthood. The study showed that utilizing social emotional health programs at a young age can help to improve these social skills. Furthermore, when students are given an opportunity to learn social skills, educators and parents are given the ability to notice those lacking these social skills and then set up immediate and intense interventions to correct this disconnect. The researchers believed that social skills are just as vital in the kindergarten classroom as academics.

This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate covers. Is KinderSocialSkills a lot of prep?This unit is a quick and simple prep! You will need to decide first if you choose to place all of the lessons on one single book ring or two separate book rings. Your next decision will be to print out the kindergarten specific covers or the generic grade covers. Print out your covers and then print out the 75 pages of lesson plan cards. Each page will have two days of lesson plans. Once the lesson cards are printed out, you will then trim around the edges and cut away the extra white paper.

What is Second Grade Math Intervention? Second Grade Math Intervention is a very versatile math intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, whole-group math, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. You will first assess how much time you have for the lesson and then make adjustments.What Does a Second Grade Math Intervention Lesson Look Like? Second Grade Math Intervention is broken down into three major areas; counting warm up, skill focus lesson, and independent practice.For the counting warm up each week the students will follow the same routine.The routines are subitizing counting, conceptual counting, critical-thinking counting, oral counting, and operational counting. For the skill focus lesson the students will follow along as the teacher guides them through the step-by-step lesson.The lesson concludes with an independent practice exit ticket.This can be done during group time or once the students are sent back to their tables. What is included within Second Grade Math Intervention? - 28 weeks of lesson plans- 140 student follow-up practice sheets- All necessary teacher/student mats for the lessons- Just add manipulatives to this packet and you're set!How Can Second Grade Math Intervention Look in MY Classroom? Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. You can move the lessons around to fit your math curriculum.If using this unit along with Second Grade Math the weeks are already aligned and match up to the “master” curriculum.A cautious word on pacing, please realize that this program can be used for intervention, lesson follow up, and enrichment.If using this program for intervention you will pace the lessons slowly and very likely repeat the lessons until students have mastered the skills.If using this program as a whole-group follow up you would most likely follow the pacing of Second Grade Math and use these lessons to rest assure students have mastered the concept.If using this packet in a guided math format to push your advanced students you would advance to the unit or lesson where you feel they would be most successful.Second Grade Math Intervention Scope and Sequence Second Grade Math Intervention is designed for a 140 day curriculum or 28 weeks. Below is a closer look at the scope and sequence of Second Grade Math Intervention. Unit One: Number Sense to 1,000 (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Two: 2 Digit Addition (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Three: 2 Digit Subtraction (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Four: Add and Sub to 1,000 (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Five: Multiplication Concepts (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Six: Division Concepts (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Seven: Measurement (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Eight: Mental Math (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Nine: Fractions (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Ten: Money (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Eleven: Time (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Twelve: Shapes and Lines (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Thirteen: Data and Graphing (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Fourteen: Time Tables 2, 5, 10 (2 weeks of instruction)I don't own Second Grade Math Can I Still Use This?

about this new PreK Math Curriculum is that Tara really thought about each and every piece of this including research and collaboration with preschool teachers to determine what would be best. At the end of the day, I appreciate that it is DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE, and PLAY BASED. I can also say, that the small group differentiation is a HUGE time saver for planning. Don't make the mistake of NOT purchasing this curriculum...it's bound to be a game changer for you!"" -Brent>>> If inquiring about this bundle for a homeschool setting, feel free to email me directly with any questions at tara@littlemindsatwork.org!Please view the preview to see the sample lesson plans/materials, and more!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

KinderSocialStudies encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. KinderSocialStudies is based upon five units: Rules, United States/Community Helpers, Maps, Countries, and Economics. Each unit is broken down to 10 lessons and each lesson can take from 1-2 days to complete. This gives you 50 days of instruction. The units cover at least two weeks of instruction. The lesson plan has the listed objective, “I can” statement, vocabulary, detailed activity lesson plans and all necessary student follow-up practice sheets. KinderSocialStudies encourages a daily routine, but please know that as the teacher you can adjust the lessons and make them best work for your daily schedule and time allotment. Within each lesson the students will partake in a quick lesson opener, whole-group skill lesson and the students will take part in a follow-up task. Please note that all student follow-up practice sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student journal. All of the follow-up sheets are also differentiated so that you can use these units anytime during the school year, and they will be applicable to your writers or nonwriters. You can also choose to have students track their daily activities in their journal with or without the included response sheets.What is included?- 2 weeks of lesson plans per unit (10 days of instruction)- Daily differentiated practice sheets (can be used for writers and non-writers)- Vocabulary Cards- *Whiteboard* Books (book per unit)- Journal labels- Necessary cards/teaching add-ons- Anchor charts- Crafts and SO much more (view the preview)- Differentiated Assessments (K-1)What units are included?Unit One: Rules Unit Two: United States Unit Three: Maps Unit Four: CountriesUnit Five: Economics Let's Take a Look at the Lessons!Unit 1: RulesUnit 1- Lesson 1: Rules (Define)Unit 1- Lesson 2: Rules (necessary)Unit 1- Lesson 3: Rules & LawsUnit 1- Lesson 4: Authority FiguresUnit 1- Lesson 5: Fairness and EqualityUnit 1- Lesson 6: ResponsibilityUnit 1- Lesson 7: HonestyUnit 1- Lesson 8: CourageUnit 1- Lesson 9: RespectUnit 1- Lesson 10: Class RulesUnit 2: United States/CommunitiesUnit 2- Lesson 1: American SymbolsUnit 2- Lesson 2: PresidentsUnit 2- Lesson 3: American FlagUnit 2- Lesson 4: DemocracyUnit 2- Lesson 5: Respecting RightsUnit 2- Lesson 6: CommunitiesUnit 2- Lesson 7: Helping the CommunityUnit 2- Lesson 8: My CommunityUnit 2- Lesson 9: Community HelpersUnit 2- Lesson 10: Meet a Community HelperUnit 3: MapsUnit 3- Lesson 1: Maps (Define)Unit 3- Lesson 2: Maps (Reading)Unit 3- Lesson 3: Maps (Creating)Unit 3- Lesson 4: Compass & DirectionsUnit 3- Lesson 5: Class Sized MapUnit 3- Lesson 6: Landforms/WaterUnit 3- Lesson 7: GlobeUnit 3- Lesson 8: ClimateUnit 3- Lesson 9: Following MapsUnit 3- Lesson 10: Maps and MeUnit 4: CountriesUnit 4- Lesson 1: IndonesiaUnit 4- Lesson 2: VietnamUnit 4- Lesson 3: The NetherlandsUnit 4- Lesson 4: GreeceUnit 4- Lesson 5: AustraliaUnit 4- Lesson 6: NigeriaUnit 4- Lesson 7: South AfricaUnit 4- Lesson 8: ArgentinaUnit 4- Lesson 9: PeruUnit 4- Lesson 10: NicaraguaUnit 5: EconomicsUnit 5- Lesson 1: We Have WantsUnit 5- Lesson 2: We Have NeedsUnit 5- Lesson 3: Wants vs. NeedsUnit 5- Lesson 4: MoneyUnit 5- Lesson 5: Saving and SpendingUnit 5- Lesson 6: Goods and ServicesUnit 5- Lesson 7: ConsumersUnit 5- Lesson 8: ProducersUnit 5- Lesson 9: Supply and DemandUnit 5- Lesson 10: Economics and IWhat about the standards? There is no one set of standards for social studies. This unit has been based upon the compilation of many state standards. Those state standards were cross-checked to verify the most common occurring standards. If the strand appeared in first grade, the first grade standard was met within the unit as well. If you have specific standards questions please reference the detailed lesson overview list above and/or email littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comAh, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate unit and bundle covers for these units. One version says 'FirstieSocialStudies' and one says 'Social Studies'.I am not from the United States, what about me?Unit 1, week 1 is the only week that is unique to the United States! In unit 2, week 2 the students will be learning about communities which can be applied to any country and not just the United States!

FirstieGrammar also offers suggestions for extension in each of the skill focuses.

Each day the students also have an optional independent sheet. You can choose a time within your day that allows you the optimum opportunity for the lessons. Also, note that there are 25 weeks of instruction. It's possible that you rotate a week on of grammar and a week off.

The Alphabet Curriculum offers a week of engaging and hands-on material per letter for a total of 130 scripted lessons. However, the material can easily be expanded over a longer academic period. Teachers can also rearrange the letters into the order they desire.

The Alphabet Curriculum is completely comprehensive, so the only thing you’ll need to add in is a few hands-on items/manipulatives! Here is a quick breakdown of what you get: What is included in The Alphabet Curriculum?Detailed lesson plans (5 lessons per letter - 130 total)Songs/poems for each letter (5 per letter)Whole-body letter cards (1 per letter)Animal action letter cards (1 per letter)Letter sound teacher mentor texts (1 per letter)Handwriting posters (2 per letter)Strokes mini booklets (2 per letter)Aligned center mats (5 per letter)Interactive notebook activities (4 per letter)Craft templates (1 per letter)Alphabet centers (20 included)Alphabet Hands-On Tasks (20 included)Handwriting Tasks (20 included)Handwriting helpersAlphabet posters, strips, resource cards, desk platesLetter assessmentStart Up GuideBlack & White file **VIDEO LINKS** (View these detailed videos for a better understanding of the program!)** Overview video: HERE** Alphabet Centers video: HERE** Hands-On Alphabet Tasks/Tubs: HERE** Handwriting Tasks/Tubs video: HERE** Actions Demo video: HERE** Alphabet Curriculum Sound tunes: HEREWhat centers are included in The Alphabet Curriculum?Center #1: Discrimination CardsCenter #2: Linking CardsCenter #3: Cover-It BoardsCenter #4: Read, Build, Write MatsCenter #5: Letter Build-It MatsCenter #6: Puzzlin' MatsCenter #7: Discrimination CardsCenter #8: Roll and Cover MatsCenter #9: Tracing CardsCenter #10: Match-UpsCenter #11: Letter Attribute SortsCenter #12: Letter Sort MatsCenter #13: Capitalization SortsCenter #14: Letter PicturesCenter #15: Sound MatsCenter #16: Letter Hunt MatsCenter #17: Letter Hunt MatsCenter #18: Letter Pull and WriteCenter #19: Letter Pull and WriteCenter #20: Letter HuntsWhat hands-on tasks/tubs are included in The Alphabet Curriculum?

The Alphabet Curriculum takes away that monotonous way of teaching the letters of the alphabet which students sit and listen to the teacher TEACH. Instead, the Alphabet Curriculum encourages guidance from the teacher while the students EXPLORE and LEARN the letters through hands-on and engaging activities that utilize all modes of learning.The Alphabet Curriculum is made up of 130 instructional days but can be adjusted to fit your classroom needs. The curriculum includes lessons, songs, centers, exploration tubs, and an assessment piece as a way to ensure student growth.These are just a few highlights you’ll see using the Alphabet Curriculum:** Kids...TALKING about letters & sounds** Manipulatives and hands-on material** Fun and engaging learning experiences** Multisensory learning approachThe Alphabet Curriculum Scope and SequenceThe Alphabet Curriculum scope and sequence should be viewed as a buffet approach. The individual teacher will need to map out the days and approach to their current school calendar. Please note that the Alphabet Curriculum was created with the teacher in mind, giving the freedom to rearrange the letters within the curriculum at your discretion. You will want to base the number of days spent on each letter according to your students’ current needs. Letter of the Week Approach: If your current approach to teaching the alphabet is one letter a week, you will not need to adjust or modify this curriculum’s structure. You can teach the letters Aa-Zz or rearrange the letters to the order of your choice. The curriculum includes 26 weeks of material for one letter per week.Alphabet Bootcamp Approach: If your current approach to teaching the alphabet is in an alphabet bootcamp approach ie., (teach letters Aa-Zz for one day each), you will choose from the included material to take it from a 5 day lesson spread down to a 1 day lesson spread. The curriculum will offer more than enough material for this approach.Standard Preschool Approach: If you would like to use this curriculum for a standard preschool approach, you will most likely follow a pattern similar to this: Teach all lesson 1’s and 2’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week and cover the introduction to all 26 capital letters. You will then go back through to teach all lesson 3’s and 4’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week and an introduction to all 26 lowercase letters. If time allows, you will teach all lesson 5’s as an end of the year review for 26 days or combining 1-2 letters a day to review. Please note you can pick and choose from each lesson and rearrange the order further. Standard Kindergarten Approach: If you would like to use this curriculum for a standard kindergarten approach, you will most likely follow a pattern similar to this: Teach all lesson 1’s and 2’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week and cover the introduction to all 26 capital letters. You will then go back through to teach all lesson 3’s, 4’s, and 5’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week, an introduction to all 26 lowercase letters, and a review of all 26 capital letters. Please note you can pick and choose from each lesson and rearrange the order further. Standard Homeschool Approach: For a homeschool approach, you can pick and choose from the above mentioned approaches to best fit your needs. Please note you can pick and choose from each lesson and rearrange the order further.How are letters introduced?Please keep in mind that the unit is set up ""buffet style"" which means I don't dictate a letter order for you...you can choose your own order or follow the order set forth by your district. This unit covers capital letters and lowercase letters! You can teach all of the capital first and then go back through to teach lowercase letters, or you can teach capital and lowercase letters simultaneously.Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

All 6 weeks of instruction encompass an overarching theme of study. The week of instruction follows a systematic and robust 5-day approach. This approach is duplicated throughout the unit for ease of instruction and quick skill mastery for students. Day 1- Students will listen to the read aloud with few stops. Students listen to background knowledge and gather new “bits of knowledge” that they learned. Day 2- Students listen to the read aloud for a second time. Educator has specific stop spots to address vocabulary. Students apply the newly learned vocabulary through kid-friendly definitions and whole-body movements. Day 3- Educators will stop on specific key learning moments from the text. Students will be asked to apply the knowledge through Level 1-3 text-dependent questions, all with the goal to add knowledge for the weekly topic.Day 4- Students will review vocabulary and add even more knowledge through real-life examples and making connections through text and themselves. Day 5- Students will once again review vocabulary, submerge themselves in a knowledge review and take an assessment. Additional printable practice available for all Days 1-4. Printable practice sheets are offered but not required. Students will be asked to add “bits of knowledge” to their knowledge case. This is a visual representation for adding information that they store in their long-term memories. It is vital that students understand and have practice with retrieving their previous learnings.INCLUDED BOOKS: Note!

Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comQ: WAIT! This seems very KinderLiteracy-ish, is it?A: This program does follow the same overall concepts of KinderLiteracy and uses the majority of the same texts. However, the focus of these digital teaching slides surrounds knowledge and making sure students apply that knowledge over multiple weeks and units. The ""case of knowledge"" is important for that. These 100% can be used in place of your KinderLiteracy instruction.Q: Is this a comprehensive approach to my literacy block?A: Keep in mind that along with vocabulary, comprehension, and knowledge which are all covered in this set, you would still need phonics, writing, grammar, and phonemic awareness for a comprehensive literacy block. I have resources for all of those areas which allows this resource to slide in perfectly!Would you like to receive notifications for my newly released resources and upcoming sales?

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms) >>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose. >>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details. >>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of KinderLiteracy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The KinderLiteracy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with KinderLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. KinderLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of KinderLiteracy, the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a KinderLiteracy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In KinderLiteracy, these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions.  Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of KinderLiteracy involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Phonemic Awareness instruction for Kindergarten and First Grade Lessons: Why is that important? “Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the K and 1st lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Please view the preview to see the unit curriculum maps, necessary books, a sample week of lesson plans/materials and more!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

FirstieWriting Units continue to build on the energy and knowledge students learned in Kindergarten.  In first grade, we strive to turn students into writers by modeling a love of writing and having an emphasis on a daily writing time in which students engage in the writing process.  In Children Want to Write edited by Tom Newkirk and Penny Kittle (2013) Donald Graves is quoted as saying, “when students write every day, they begin to compose even when they are not composing.  They enter into a constant state of composition” (p. 58). Research conducted by Hattie and Gladwell both concluded that there is a direct correlation between the amount of time we spend in pursuit of a habit, goal or skill and our individual growth in relation to that habit, goal or skill.  In other words, for students to improve as writers, and build stamina, it is important for them to have long stretches of writing time that occur on a daily basis.  Within each writing unit, conferencing with students happens every day.  Small group work and conferencing with students is one of the most important parts in the writer’s workshop.  Conferring is working one-on-one, or in a small group setting, with a student to listen and understand a child’s work and intentions.  The teacher also provides effective feedback to make sure the learner is working with direction. Learning progressions and student checklists are important tools that promote self-assessment and goal setting so instruction can be differentiated to each individual learner.  For any learner to grow stronger, the learner must be provided with informative, responsive feedback. Hattie’s (2008) research revealed feedback is especially valuable if the teacher helps the learner know where he is going, what progress he has made so far, and what specific activities he can do next to progress towards the goal.  Calkins (1994) believes “perfect practice makes perfect,” which means that students need long stretches of time, along with specific feedback aligned to next steps for them as writers, in order to progress. Mentor texts are used throughout each writing unit.  Students benefit from examples and one of the most effective ways to teach writing is to use mentor texts.  By looking at examples of good writing, especially in published work, students learn to aspire to create effective pieces of their own.  What about the standards? Each unit has a focus standard that is based upon the Common Core Standards. Units further into the year will have more than one focus standard.

Snag the bundle now and SAVE BIG!What is the 2nd Grade Math Curriculum?Tara West’s 2nd Grade Math units are teacher created, kid-tested, and most importantly - kid-approved! The 2nd Grade Math units take away that monotonous way of teaching math where students sit and listen to the teacher TEACH math. Instead, they encourage guidance from the teacher while the students TEACH and LEARN math through hands-on and engaging math activities with their partners.2nd Grade Math units are made up of 10+ instructional days each, but can be adjusted to fit your classroom needs. The units include a pre- and post-test as a way to ensure student growth over the unit.What is the scope and sequence?The 2nd Grade Math Curriculum is a 30 week math curriculum that includes lesson plans that break down a 60 minute block math time into these sections {warm up, whole-group number sense, whole-group fluency, whole-group math lesson, collaborate lesson follow-up aka pair work and independent practice aka worksheet}. The units will also include any and all cards needed to make the lessons successful! You will just need to provide the manipulatives!The 2nd Grade Math Curriculum is a simple print and teach math curriculum. No more tracking down ideas, worksheets, cards, etc! I have it covered! What is included in the 2nd Grade Math Curriculum?- Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose to do so. If so I have included editable lesson plans.- Each week I have planned out the; big idea, focus standards, vocabulary, checks for understanding, critical thinking starters, and material/prep list.- 2 page Pre-Test and 2 page Post-Test included (answers keys + EXCEL data tracker)2nd Grade Math Curriculum UnitsUnit One: Number Sense to 1,000 Unit Two: 2 Digit Addition Unit Three: 2 Digit Subtraction Unit Four: Add and Sub to 1,000 Unit Five: Multiplication Concepts Unit Six: Division Concepts Unit Seven: Measurement Unit Eight: Mental MathUnit Nine: FractionsUnit Ten: Money Unit Eleven: Time Unit Twelve: Shapes and LinesUnit Thirteen: Data and GraphingUnit Fourteen: Time Tables 2, 5, 10Unit Fifteen: 3rd Grade PrepA Closer Look at the Included Lessons!Unit 1: Number Sense to 1,000Lesson 1.1 Place Value up to 1,000Lesson 1.2 Drawing Base 10 Blocks To Represent Numbers to 1,000Lesson 1.3 Writing the Word Form To Represent Numbers to 1,000Lesson 1.4 Expanded Form of Numbers To 1,000Lesson 1.5 Place Value of Numbers to 1,000Lesson 1.6 Comparing NumbersLesson 1.7 Ordering Numbers from Least to GreatestLesson 1.8 Ordering Numbers from Greatest to LeastLesson 1.9 Skip Counting by 5’sLesson 1.10 Skip Counting by 100’sLesson 1.11 Skip Counting by 10’sUnit Two: 2 Digit AdditionLesson 2.1 Adding 2-Digit Numbers with a 100’s ChartLesson 2.2 Adding 2-Digit Numbers with an Open LineLesson 2.3 Decomposing a Number into a Number Bond to AddLesson 2.4 Addition by Breaking Apart Tens and OnesLesson 2.5 2-Digit Addition W/O Regrouping Using Base Ten BlocksLesson 2.6 2-Digit Addition W/O Regrouping by Drawing Base Ten BlocksLesson 2.7 2-Digit Addition With Regrouping by Drawing Base Ten BlocksLesson 2.8 Adding More Than 2 AddendsLesson 2.9 Adding With the Traditional AlgorithmLesson 2.10 One-Step Real World Word ProblemsUnit Three: 2 Digit SubtractionLesson 3.1 Subtracting 2-Digit Numbers with a 100’s ChartLesson 3.2 Subtracting 2-Digit Numbers with an Open LineLesson 3.3 Subtraction by Decomposing Numbers into Number BondsLesson 3.4 Subtraction by Breaking Apart Tens and OnesLesson 3.5 2-Digit Subtraction W/O Regrouping Using Base Ten BlocksLesson 3.6 2-Digit Subtraction W/O Regrouping by Drawing Base Ten BlocksLesson 3.7 2-Digit Subtraction With Regrouping by Drawing Base Ten BlocksLesson 3.8 Subtraction with the Traditional AlgorithmLesson 3.9 One-Step Real World ProblemsLesson 3.10 Two-Step Real World Word ProblemsUnit Four: Addition and Subtraction to 1,000Lesson 4.1 Adding 3-Digit Numbers with an Open Number LineLesson 4.2 3-Digit Addition Without Regrouping Using a Place Value ChartLesson 4.3 3-Digit Addition With Regrouping Using a Place Value ChartLesson 4.4 3-Digit Addition With Regrouping Using a Place Value ChartLesson 4.5 3-Digit Addition With Regrouping Using a Place Value ChartLesson 4.6 Subtracting 3-Digit Numbers with an Open Number LineLesson 4.7 3-Digit Subtraction Without Regrouping Using a Place Value ChartLesson 4.8 3-Digit Subtraction: Regrouping Tens and OnesLesson 4.9 3-Digit Subtraction: Decomposing Hundreds and Regrouping in the TensLesson 4.10 3-Digit Subtraction: Decomposing Hundreds and TensLesson 4.11 Subtraction Across ZerosUnit Five: Multiplication ConceptsLesson 5.1 Multiplication Concepts – Skip Counting Using a 100’s ChartLesson 5.2 Multiplication Concepts – Skip Counting Using a Number LineLesson 5.3 Multiplication Concepts – Arrays: Introduction to Columns and RowsLesson 5.4 Multiplication Concepts – Arrays: Repeated AdditionLesson 5.5 Multiplication Concepts – Creating ArraysLesson 5.6 Multiplication Concepts – Creating Arrays with Repeated AdditionLesson 5.7 Multiplication Concepts – Using Arrays to Solve Word ProblemsLesson 5.8 Multiplication Concepts – Connecting Arrays to MultiplicationLesson 5.9 Multiplication Concepts – Creating Equal GroupsUnit Six: Division ConceptsLesson 6.1 Odd and Even Numbers- Pictorial RepresentationLesson 6.2 Odd and Even Numbers- Place ValueLesson 6.3 Relating Doubles to Even Numbers and Writing Number SentencesLesson 6.4 Division Concepts – Skip Counting Using a 100’s ChartLesson 6.5 Division Concepts – Skip Counting Backwards Using a Number LineLesson 6.6 Division Concepts- Arrays: Introduction to Columns and RowsLesson 6.7 Division Concepts- Arrays: Repeated SubtractionLesson 6.8 Division Concepts- Creating ArraysLesson 6.9 Division Concepts- Using Arrays to Solve Word ProblemsLesson 6.10 Division Concepts- Creating Equal GroupsUnit Seven: MeasurementLesson 7.1 Measurement Tools -

KinderWriting® encourages young learners to look inward at their endless possibilities as a writer. KinderWriting® is based upon nine units: Writing With Pictures, Writing With Sentences, Writing With Stories, Writing With Narrative, Writing With Opinion, Writing With Direction, Writing With Persuasion, Writing With Imagination, and Writing With Information. Each unit is broken down to 20 lessons. The units cover 20 days of academic instruction. The lesson plans have listed unit objectives, “I can” statements, Common Core writing standards and needed mentor texts. KinderWriting encourages a daily routine of a minilesson, independent writing, and a share time. Each of the lessons in KinderWriting are well thought out for the young writer and spiral back to previous lessons to ensure students are retaining their skills. KinderWriting also includes unit anchor charts, a variety of writing paper, conferring schedules and note sheets, sample writings, student writing goals display, writing rubrics, and step-by-step guides that are made specifically for each unit. What is included in KinderWritring Curriculum?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do.

Each unit has a focus standard that is based upon the Common Core Standards. Units further into the year will have more than one focus standard. If you teach to a varying set of standards, you can email me for assistance. Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

This curriculum was designed to include the best practices for the Science of Reading. The unit was heavily researched and vetted by a team of educators. The Guided Phonics + Beyond Curriculum is designed to include all needed material to lead your whole-group phonics block and your small-group learning block. Each lesson plan has designated components and routines for both whole-group learning and small-group learning. The program includes a scope and sequence. This scope and sequence can be applied to any time frame. You can teach a new lesson every day, a new lesson every two days, and so on. Adjust the units to fit your students at that moment in time.

If you teach to a varying set of standards, you can email me for assistance. Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

"Lettervention: Kindergarten Letter Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work","Lettervention CurriculumLettervention is a very versatile 52 week intensive letter curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is designed to give kindergarten students a solid foundation in letter names and sounds. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction",https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/Lettervention-Curriculum-2590533-1717295270/original-2590533-1.jpg,https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Lettervention-Kindergarten-Letter-Intervention-Curriculum-2590533,"Lettervention CurriculumLettervention is a very versatile 52 week intensive letter curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is designed to give kindergarten students a solid foundation in letter names and sounds. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. Lettervention is designed to give each lowercase letter and each capital letter two days of instruction each. That totals out to 104 academic days. If you choose to do two letters per week that would be 52 academic weeks. You will find that the letter order found within Lettervention follows a researched based order that encourages introducing students to letters that follow similar paths of motion. However, please note that this order is NOT dependent on the success of the program. You can change the order of the letters in any way or fashion. The program will still have a great success rate, no matter the order.Why does Lettervention Work?Please note that Lettervention is a VERY systematic program. What does this mean and why is it successful? Research has proved two important keys in education of young children. The first being that some students need to “see” a skill many repeated times to gain an understanding of that skill. With Lettervention students will hear a constant flow of “repeated language.” This repeated language will help students to hear and see the skill over and over again. Thus helping with their processing of that skill and aiding to skill mastery. Research has also shown that when students participate in systematic programs the success rates are very high. The students become aware of the routine very quickly and are able to flow through the lesson, focusing on the skill change and not the lesson format change. In Lettervention they know they’ll start with a warm up, be introduced to a letter, practice that letter, and then apply their knowledge independently. This allows the ease and comfort for the students. Not to mention systematic programs are such a blessing for teachers. The routines and procedures are set once and then can simply be reviewed. What does a sample week look like? Lettervention is broken down into four areas (warm up, letter introduction/review, letter/handwriting applied practice, and then daily independent practice. The students will participate in a very quick ABC warm up and then the teacher will introduce that day’s new letter. On day two of that letter the teacher will review the letter. On day one the students will apply their knowledge of that letter and on day two they will be introduced to the handwriting paths of motion. Each day the students will participate in a very quick exit ticket to show their mastery. On day two’s lesson if the included handwriting paths of motion do not match yours, there is an editable version included where you can make those changes.I don't follow the same scope and sequence. What about me? These lessons are 100% stand-alone! You can combine, swap, alter, etc anyway you see fit! You can choose to teach capitals first or lowercase as well!What is included in Lettervention?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans for 104 instructional days. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans. -Letter sound cards (3 versions)-ABC Chart-Handwriting template mat*Neal font version added! I already have KinderWordBuilding (kindergarten intervention), KinderStart and/or KinderPhonics. How is this different? Lettervention is strictly the letters of the alphabet (sound and name). KinderWordBuilding starts right with CVC words. A lot of kinders are not yet ready for CVC words. KinderStart does introduce phonic skills but never teaches the letters exclusively. KinderPhonics is a whole group curriculum that does teach letters and sounds. However, it's most likely that you still have a group of kiddos that need intensive letter instruction beyond the whole group lesson. That is where Lettervention comes in!I'm in LOVE please tell me moreYou can listen in to me talk all about Lettervention by clicking HERE!* *Please note that this unit is complete with all necessary material. It is NOT a growing bundle that you wait for updates!Please view the preview to see the sample lesson plans/materials, and more!If you haven't spotted KinderWordBuilding yet a CVC and beyond based program for kindergarten you can check it out HERE!If you are a first grade teacher you can check out my FirstieventionI am a teacher, you are a teacher... so I'm here to help!
