""My district uses a math program that quite frankly stinks! I have been struggling for three years to teach math in a way that makes sense and truly reaches my students.

"FirstieMath® First Grade Math Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FirstieMath-First-Grade-Math-Intervention-Curriculum-3220934,"FirstieMath® Intervention: A 30 week comprehensive and systematic math intervention curriculum. What is FirstieMath™ Intervention? FirstieMath® Intervention is a very versatile math intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, whole-group math, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. You will first assess how much time you have for the lesson and then make adjustments.What Does a FirstieMath® Intervention Lesson Look Like? FirstieMath® Intervention is broken down into three major areas; counting warm up, skill focus lesson, and independent practice. For the counting warm up each week the students will follow the same routine. The routines are subitizing counting, conceptual counting, critical-thinking counting, oral counting, and operational counting. For the skill focus lesson the students will follow along as the teacher guides them through the step-by-step lesson. The lesson concludes with an independent practice exit ticket. This can be done during group time or once the students are sent back to their tables. What is included within FirstieMath® Intervention? - 30 weeks of lesson plans- 150 student follow-up practice sheets- All necessary teacher ""cards"" for the lessons- Just add manipulatives to this packet and you're set!How Can FirstieMath® Intervention Look in MY Classroom? Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. You can move the lessons around to fit your math curriculum. If using this unit along with FirstieMath™ the weeks are already aligned and match up to the “master” curriculum. A cautious word on pacing, please realize that this program can be used for intervention, lesson follow up, and enrichment. If using this program for intervention you will pace the lessons slowly and very likely repeat the lessons until students have mastered the skills. If using this program as a whole-group follow up you would most likely follow the pacing of FirstieMath® and use these lessons to rest assure students have mastered the concept. If using this packet in a guided math format to push your advanced students you would advance to the unit or lesson where you feel they would be most successful. FirstieMath® Intervention Scope and Sequence FirstieMath® Intervention is designed for a 150 day curriculum or 30 weeks. Below is a closer look at the scope and sequence of FirstieMath® Intervention. Unit 1 Numbers to 10: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 2 Addition to 10: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 3 Subtraction to 10: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 4 Geometry: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 5 Numbers to 20: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 6 Add and Subtract within 20: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 7 Measurable Attributes: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 8 Graphing: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 9 Numbers to 40: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 10 Add and Subtract within 40: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 11 Math Strategies: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 12 Numbers to 120: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 13 Add and Subtract within 100: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 14 Time and Money: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included)Unit 15 2nd Grade Prep: (2 weeks of intervention instruction included) I don't own FirstieMath. Can I Still Use This? Of course! FirstieMath follows a scope and sequence that is common in most if not all first grade math classrooms! These lessons are based upon those common skill focuses! I teach Kindergarten. Can I Still Use This? A lot of kindergarten teachers are desperately searching for a way to differentiate in their classrooms for their higher leveled students. This packet does offer 30 weeks of lesson plans and practice sheets! This would be great for a guided math group, support staff member's instruction, and perfect a ""pull back"" group of students.

If you teach to a varying set of standards, you can email me for assistance. Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

This packet is designed for the preschool and kindergarten classroom and easily adapted to fit a guardian-led homeschool setting!

ALL OF THE DAY ONE STORIES ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN A GOOGLE SLIDES VERSION ALONG WITH THE PRINTABLES! >>> VIEW A PREVIEW VIDEO OF THE GOOGLE VERSION HERE <<< What is KinderSocialSkills?KinderSocialSkills Curriculum is an engaging social skills curriculum with young learners in mind! KinderSocialSkills takes 75 common social skills and teaches them in a kid-friendly way for students. The students are able to grow and develop by listening to the social stories. The social stories contain two main characters, Tom Cat and Tabby Cat. The two cats will take the students on adventures as they are introduced to the broad social skills context through both home and school settings.Watch a video of the program ** HERE ** What is the structure of KinderSocialSkills?KinderSocialSkills consists of 75 two-day lesson plans. Day one is an introduction of the skill and a social story. Day two is a review of the skill and a hands-on approach to applying the skill. On the second day the students are also asked to deeply think and apply the skill to their own lives. On both days the students will interact with their peers through verbal discussions. The teacher will lead the initial conversation and then turn it over to the students for their opportunity to have collaborative peer discussion. KinderSocialSkills also includes a follow-up independent writing sheet for each skill. This is a way for the students to put the skill on paper and for parents to be connected with the skill of the day. There is a note at the bottom of each paper so parents can track the social skill and hopefully continue the discussion of that skill at home.What is included in KinderSocialSkills?- 150 social skill lessons (75 skills spanning over 2 days each) *day one is a social story and day two is follow-up) - 75 follow-up student sheets (2 differentiated versions included for non-writers and writers)- paper clip art cat ""puppets""- notebook labels- journal coversWhat does the RESEARCH say about KinderSocialSkills?Research shows us social skills are at times a bigger indicator for future success in life than academics (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2015). That statement is profound. A longitudinal study regarding kindergarten students and social skills was conducted by Drs. Damon Jones and Mark Greenberg, both professors at Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Max Crowley, a professor from Duke University. The kindergarten students were tracked over a 20 year period and the results were astonishing. The predictions made in kindergarten based upon their social skills had a direct correlation with outcomes met in mid-adulthood and later adulthood. The study showed that utilizing social emotional health programs at a young age can help to improve these social skills. Furthermore, when students are given an opportunity to learn social skills, educators and parents are given the ability to notice those lacking these social skills and then set up immediate and intense interventions to correct this disconnect. The researchers believed that social skills are just as vital in the kindergarten classroom as academics.

This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate covers. Is KinderSocialSkills a lot of prep?This unit is a quick and simple prep! You will need to decide first if you choose to place all of the lessons on one single book ring or two separate book rings. Your next decision will be to print out the kindergarten specific covers or the generic grade covers. Print out your covers and then print out the 75 pages of lesson plan cards. Each page will have two days of lesson plans. Once the lesson cards are printed out, you will then trim around the edges and cut away the extra white paper. Next, you will need to hole punch each of the lesson cards. Place the cards onto the book ring(s) and you are good to go. You can place the student response sheets in a teacher master binder or make student journals. Laminating the lesson cards is optional. Printing the lesson cards on cardstock is recommended for durability.View KinderSocialSkills Version TWO here! **Be sure to view the preview for lots of pictures!**Visit my blog Little Minds at Work Follow me on Facebook>> YEAR-LONG CURRICULUM BUNDLES: PreschoolKindergartenKindergarten (Digital Slides)First Grade2nd Grade>> YEAR-LONG CURRICULUM MAPSPreschoolKindergartenKindergarten (Digital Slides)First Grade2nd Grade"

"Second Grade Math Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Second-Grade-Math-Intervention-Curriculum-4407890,"Second Grade Math Intervention Curriculum: A 28 week comprehensive and systematic math intervention curriculum. What is Second Grade Math Intervention? Second Grade Math Intervention is a very versatile math intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, whole-group math, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. You will first assess how much time you have for the lesson and then make adjustments.What Does a Second Grade Math Intervention Lesson Look Like? Second Grade Math Intervention is broken down into three major areas; counting warm up, skill focus lesson, and independent practice.For the counting warm up each week the students will follow the same routine.The routines are subitizing counting, conceptual counting, critical-thinking counting, oral counting, and operational counting. For the skill focus lesson the students will follow along as the teacher guides them through the step-by-step lesson.The lesson concludes with an independent practice exit ticket.This can be done during group time or once the students are sent back to their tables. What is included within Second Grade Math Intervention? - 28 weeks of lesson plans- 140 student follow-up practice sheets- All necessary teacher/student mats for the lessons- Just add manipulatives to this packet and you're set!How Can Second Grade Math Intervention Look in MY Classroom? Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. You can move the lessons around to fit your math curriculum.If using this unit along with Second Grade Math the weeks are already aligned and match up to the “master” curriculum.A cautious word on pacing, please realize that this program can be used for intervention, lesson follow up, and enrichment.If using this program for intervention you will pace the lessons slowly and very likely repeat the lessons until students have mastered the skills.If using this program as a whole-group follow up you would most likely follow the pacing of Second Grade Math and use these lessons to rest assure students have mastered the concept.If using this packet in a guided math format to push your advanced students you would advance to the unit or lesson where you feel they would be most successful.Second Grade Math Intervention Scope and Sequence Second Grade Math Intervention is designed for a 140 day curriculum or 28 weeks. Below is a closer look at the scope and sequence of Second Grade Math Intervention. Unit One: Number Sense to 1,000 (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Two: 2 Digit Addition (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Three: 2 Digit Subtraction (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Four: Add and Sub to 1,000 (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Five: Multiplication Concepts (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Six: Division Concepts (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Seven: Measurement (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Eight: Mental Math (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Nine: Fractions (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Ten: Money (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Eleven: Time (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Twelve: Shapes and Lines (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Thirteen: Data and Graphing (2 weeks of instruction)Unit Fourteen: Time Tables 2, 5, 10 (2 weeks of instruction)I don't own Second Grade Math Can I Still Use This?

about this new PreK Math Curriculum is that Tara really thought about each and every piece of this including research and collaboration with preschool teachers to determine what would be best. At the end of the day, I appreciate that it is DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE, and PLAY BASED. I can also say, that the small group differentiation is a HUGE time saver for planning.

These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate unit and bundle covers for these units. One version says 'FirstieSocialStudies' and one says 'Social Studies'.I am not from the United States, what about me?Unit 1, week 1 is the only week that is unique to the United States!

"FirstieGrammar First Grade Grammar Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FirstieGrammar-First-Grade-Grammar-Curriculum-2634627,"FirstieGrammar CurriculumFirstieGrammar Curriculum is a 25 week or 125 academic day systematic curriculum. FirstieGrammar Curriculum covers 25 skill focuses and includes 5 simple “print and teach” lessons per skill. The lessons are scripted for ease of teaching. Each day the students also have exit tickets to match the skill. With the average school year being 30 weeks, this program offers flexibility that you can repeat the lessons more than once or rotate grammar with another pressing area of instruction within your classroom day. FirstieGrammar Curriculum lessons are meant to be quick and to the point. The teacher simply introduces or reviews the concepts, build upon the concept from previous lessons, engages the students in a discussion about the skill, requires students to show mastery of the skill, and then allows the students an opportunity for independent practice. How Can I use FirstieGrammar in my Class?You can add FirstieGrammar into your morning routine, reading block, writing block, or any other time of the day that you have about 10 minutes of instruction time. FirstieGrammar also offers suggestions for extension in each of the skill focuses. If you do not have a long period of time for the lessons you can choose to eliminate the daily practice sheet or do it whole-group as well.Tell me more about ""fitting"" FirstieGrammar in... FirstieGrammar is designed to be a quick and efficient whole-group lesson. The lesson itself can range from 10 minutes and upward according to how much you would like to expand it. Each day the students also have an optional independent sheet. You can choose a time within your day that allows you the optimum opportunity for the lessons. Also, note that there are 25 weeks of instruction. It's possible that you rotate a week on of grammar and a week off. Grammar is a vital part of our instruction that in a lot of cases has fallen ""off the grid."" FirstieGrammar allows you the opportunity to bring it back with the ease and efficiency of each lesson!What Skills Are Included in FirstieGrammar?NounsVerbsAdjectivesComparative/Superlative AdjectivesAdverbsProper NounsPlural NounsIrregular Plural NounsPossessive NounsComplete SentencesCompound SentencesCommas in SeriesStatementsExclamationsQuestionsCommandsArticlesSubject/VerbPresent/Past/FutureAffirmative VerbsPrepositionsPronounsPossessive PronounsIndefinite PronounsBe sure to view the preview to see a sample lesson!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms) >>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose. >>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details. >>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of KinderLiteracy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The KinderLiteracy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with KinderLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. KinderLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of KinderLiteracy, the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a KinderLiteracy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In KinderLiteracy, these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions.  Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of KinderLiteracy involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Phonemic Awareness instruction for Kindergarten and First Grade Lessons: Why is that important? “Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the K and 1st lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Please view the preview to see the unit curriculum maps, necessary books, a sample week of lesson plans/materials and more!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

KinderWriting® encourages young learners to look inward at their endless possibilities as a writer. KinderWriting® is based upon nine units: Writing With Pictures, Writing With Sentences, Writing With Stories, Writing With Narrative, Writing With Opinion, Writing With Direction, Writing With Persuasion, Writing With Imagination, and Writing With Information. Each unit is broken down to 20 lessons. The units cover 20 days of academic instruction. The lesson plans have listed unit objectives, “I can” statements, Common Core writing standards and needed mentor texts. KinderWriting encourages a daily routine of a minilesson, independent writing, and a share time. Each of the lessons in KinderWriting are well thought out for the young writer and spiral back to previous lessons to ensure students are retaining their skills. KinderWriting also includes unit anchor charts, a variety of writing paper, conferring schedules and note sheets, sample writings, student writing goals display, writing rubrics, and step-by-step guides that are made specifically for each unit. What is included in KinderWritring Curriculum?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do.

I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this!

All 6 weeks of instruction encompass an overarching theme of study. The week of instruction follows a systematic and robust 5-day approach. This approach is duplicated throughout the unit for ease of instruction and quick skill mastery for students. Day 1- Students will listen to the read aloud with few stops. Students listen to background knowledge and gather new “bits of knowledge” that they learned. Day 2- Students listen to the read aloud for a second time. Educator has specific stop spots to address vocabulary. Students apply the newly learned vocabulary through kid-friendly definitions and whole-body movements. Day 3- Educators will stop on specific key learning moments from the text. Students will be asked to apply the knowledge through Level 1-3 text-dependent questions, all with the goal to add knowledge for the weekly topic.Day 4- Students will review vocabulary and add even more knowledge through real-life examples and making connections through text and themselves. Day 5- Students will once again review vocabulary, submerge themselves in a knowledge review and take an assessment. Additional printable practice available for all Days 1-4. Printable practice sheets are offered but not required. Students will be asked to add “bits of knowledge” to their knowledge case. This is a visual representation for adding information that they store in their long-term memories. It is vital that students understand and have practice with retrieving their previous learnings.INCLUDED BOOKS: Note!

Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comQ: WAIT! This seems very KinderLiteracy-ish, is it?A: This program does follow the same overall concepts of KinderLiteracy and uses the majority of the same texts. However, the focus of these digital teaching slides surrounds knowledge and making sure students apply that knowledge over multiple weeks and units. The ""case of knowledge"" is important for that. These 100% can be used in place of your KinderLiteracy instruction.Q: Is this a comprehensive approach to my literacy block?A: Keep in mind that along with vocabulary, comprehension, and knowledge which are all covered in this set, you would still need phonics, writing, grammar, and phonemic awareness for a comprehensive literacy block. I have resources for all of those areas which allows this resource to slide in perfectly!Would you like to receive notifications for my newly released resources and upcoming sales?

"Lettervention: Kindergarten Letter Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Lettervention-Kindergarten-Letter-Intervention-Curriculum-2590533,"Lettervention CurriculumLettervention is a very versatile 52 week intensive letter curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is designed to give kindergarten students a solid foundation in letter names and sounds. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. Lettervention is designed to give each lowercase letter and each capital letter two days of instruction each. That totals out to 104 academic days. If you choose to do two letters per week that would be 52 academic weeks. You will find that the letter order found within Lettervention follows a researched based order that encourages introducing students to letters that follow similar paths of motion. However, please note that this order is NOT dependent on the success of the program. You can change the order of the letters in any way or fashion. The program will still have a great success rate, no matter the order.Why does Lettervention Work?Please note that Lettervention is a VERY systematic program. What does this mean and why is it successful? Research has proved two important keys in education of young children. The first being that some students need to “see” a skill many repeated times to gain an understanding of that skill. With Lettervention students will hear a constant flow of “repeated language.” This repeated language will help students to hear and see the skill over and over again. Thus helping with their processing of that skill and aiding to skill mastery. Research has also shown that when students participate in systematic programs the success rates are very high. The students become aware of the routine very quickly and are able to flow through the lesson, focusing on the skill change and not the lesson format change. In Lettervention they know they’ll start with a warm up, be introduced to a letter, practice that letter, and then apply their knowledge independently. This allows the ease and comfort for the students. Not to mention systematic programs are such a blessing for teachers. The routines and procedures are set once and then can simply be reviewed. What does a sample week look like? Lettervention is broken down into four areas (warm up, letter introduction/review, letter/handwriting applied practice, and then daily independent practice. The students will participate in a very quick ABC warm up and then the teacher will introduce that day’s new letter. On day two of that letter the teacher will review the letter. On day one the students will apply their knowledge of that letter and on day two they will be introduced to the handwriting paths of motion. Each day the students will participate in a very quick exit ticket to show their mastery. On day two’s lesson if the included handwriting paths of motion do not match yours, there is an editable version included where you can make those changes.I don't follow the same scope and sequence. What about me? These lessons are 100% stand-alone! You can combine, swap, alter, etc anyway you see fit! You can choose to teach capitals first or lowercase as well!What is included in Lettervention?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans for 104 instructional days. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans. -Letter sound cards (3 versions)-ABC Chart-Handwriting template mat*Neal font version added! I already have KinderWordBuilding (kindergarten intervention), KinderStart and/or KinderPhonics. How is this different? Lettervention is strictly the letters of the alphabet (sound and name). KinderWordBuilding starts right with CVC words. A lot of kinders are not yet ready for CVC words. KinderStart does introduce phonic skills but never teaches the letters exclusively. KinderPhonics is a whole group curriculum that does teach letters and sounds. However, it's most likely that you still have a group of kiddos that need intensive letter instruction beyond the whole group lesson. That is where Lettervention comes in!I'm in LOVE please tell me moreYou can listen in to me talk all about Lettervention by clicking HERE!* *Please note that this unit is complete with all necessary material. It is NOT a growing bundle that you wait for updates!Please view the preview to see the sample lesson plans/materials, and more!If you haven't spotted KinderWordBuilding yet a CVC and beyond based program for kindergarten you can check it out HERE!If you are a first grade teacher you can check out my FirstieventionI am a teacher, you are a teacher... so I'm here to help!

FirstieWriting Units continue to build on the energy and knowledge students learned in Kindergarten.  In first grade, we strive to turn students into writers by modeling a love of writing and having an emphasis on a daily writing time in which students engage in the writing process.  In Children Want to Write edited by Tom Newkirk and Penny Kittle (2013) Donald Graves is quoted as saying, “when students write every day, they begin to compose even when they are not composing.  They enter into a constant state of composition” (p. 58). Research conducted by Hattie and Gladwell both concluded that there is a direct correlation between the amount of time we spend in pursuit of a habit, goal or skill and our individual growth in relation to that habit, goal or skill.  In other words, for students to improve as writers, and build stamina, it is important for them to have long stretches of writing time that occur on a daily basis.  Within each writing unit, conferencing with students happens every day.  Small group work and conferencing with students is one of the most important parts in the writer’s workshop.  Conferring is working one-on-one, or in a small group setting, with a student to listen and understand a child’s work and intentions.  The teacher also provides effective feedback to make sure the learner is working with direction. Learning progressions and student checklists are important tools that promote self-assessment and goal setting so instruction can be differentiated to each individual learner.  For any learner to grow stronger, the learner must be provided with informative, responsive feedback. Hattie’s (2008) research revealed feedback is especially valuable if the teacher helps the learner know where he is going, what progress he has made so far, and what specific activities he can do next to progress towards the goal.  Calkins (1994) believes “perfect practice makes perfect,” which means that students need long stretches of time, along with specific feedback aligned to next steps for them as writers, in order to progress. Mentor texts are used throughout each writing unit.  Students benefit from examples and one of the most effective ways to teach writing is to use mentor texts.  By looking at examples of good writing, especially in published work, students learn to aspire to create effective pieces of their own.  What about the standards? Each unit has a focus standard that is based upon the Common Core Standards. Units further into the year will have more than one focus standard. If you teach to a varying set of standards, you can email me for assistance.

The Alphabet Curriculum takes away that monotonous way of teaching the letters of the alphabet which students sit and listen to the teacher TEACH. Instead, the Alphabet Curriculum encourages guidance from the teacher while the students EXPLORE and LEARN the letters through hands-on and engaging activities that utilize all modes of learning.The Alphabet Curriculum is made up of 130 instructional days but can be adjusted to fit your classroom needs. The curriculum includes lessons, songs, centers, exploration tubs, and an assessment piece as a way to ensure student growth.These are just a few highlights you’ll see using the Alphabet Curriculum:** Kids...TALKING about letters & sounds** Manipulatives and hands-on material** Fun and engaging learning experiences** Multisensory learning approachThe Alphabet Curriculum Scope and SequenceThe Alphabet Curriculum scope and sequence should be viewed as a buffet approach. The individual teacher will need to map out the days and approach to their current school calendar. Please note that the Alphabet Curriculum was created with the teacher in mind, giving the freedom to rearrange the letters within the curriculum at your discretion. You will want to base the number of days spent on each letter according to your students’ current needs. Letter of the Week Approach: If your current approach to teaching the alphabet is one letter a week, you will not need to adjust or modify this curriculum’s structure. You can teach the letters Aa-Zz or rearrange the letters to the order of your choice. The curriculum includes 26 weeks of material for one letter per week.Alphabet Bootcamp Approach: If your current approach to teaching the alphabet is in an alphabet bootcamp approach ie., (teach letters Aa-Zz for one day each), you will choose from the included material to take it from a 5 day lesson spread down to a 1 day lesson spread. The curriculum will offer more than enough material for this approach.Standard Preschool Approach: If you would like to use this curriculum for a standard preschool approach, you will most likely follow a pattern similar to this: Teach all lesson 1’s and 2’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week and cover the introduction to all 26 capital letters. You will then go back through to teach all lesson 3’s and 4’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week and an introduction to all 26 lowercase letters. If time allows, you will teach all lesson 5’s as an end of the year review for 26 days or combining 1-2 letters a day to review. Please note you can pick and choose from each lesson and rearrange the order further. Standard Kindergarten Approach: If you would like to use this curriculum for a standard kindergarten approach, you will most likely follow a pattern similar to this: Teach all lesson 1’s and 2’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week and cover the introduction to all 26 capital letters. You will then go back through to teach all lesson 3’s, 4’s, and 5’s. This will give you material for 2 letters a week, an introduction to all 26 lowercase letters, and a review of all 26 capital letters.

This curriculum was designed to include the best practices for the Science of Reading. The unit was heavily researched and vetted by a team of educators. The Guided Phonics + Beyond Curriculum is designed to include all needed material to lead your whole-group phonics block and your small-group learning block. Each lesson plan has designated components and routines for both whole-group learning and small-group learning. The program includes a scope and sequence. This scope and sequence can be applied to any time frame. You can teach a new lesson every day, a new lesson every two days, and so on. Adjust the units to fit your students at that moment in time. Unit 1: Pre-Readers, is designed to give students a solid foundation in: phonological awareness, letter identification, letter sounds, and handwriting. Students will progress through the alphabet in alphabetical order. It’s encouraged that you expose students to the alphabet chart, traditional ABC song, alphabet hunts, and/or other fun and engaging ways to bring the alphabet to life. The unit has a pre and post assessment to track student learning. The Pre-Readers unit also includes work on articulation, multisensory learning, and fluency. Looking ahead.

Add the binders and page protectors to your school supply list or possibly ask for donations to maximize your budget.Supplies: Each student will need a few minimal supplies for their center time. These supplies can be stored in a binder pouch, baggie, or their supply box. Students will need a dry erase marker, spinner, dot cube, and counters/mini erasers. You might also choose to supply students with a reading wand, toy car, or googly reading eyes.OPTIONAL Teacher ""Master Copies"" Binder: Set up a ‘master’ binder for each skill. By doing so you can quick swap pages from binders and access new sheets to stuff the page protectors with. This is optional. You can also just use the digital PDF version and print what you need. Then save these printed versions to create your binder ‘as you go’ through the year.OPTIONAL Guided Reading or Intervention Binder: Set up a binder for students to use during guided reading, intervention, or small-group time. The binder will be stuffed with pages just like the independent binder. Keep the binders near your table so you can quickly access them during group time. Students will also need access to supplies like the independent binders.What sight words are included?The list is Dolch Pre-Primer, Dolch Primer, Fry's top 100, Zeno top 50!aaboutafterallamanandareasaskatateawaybebecausebeenbigblackbluebrownbutbycamecancomecoulddaydiddodowneacheateveryfindfirstfiveforfourfromfunnygetgivegogoodgreenhadhashavehehelpherherehimhishowIifinintoisitjumpjustlikelittlelookmademakemanymaymemoremostmuchmustmynewnonotnowofoffoneoneonlyororangeotherouroutoverpartpeoplepinkplaypleaseprettypurpleputredsawsaidsayseeshesixsosomesoontakethanthatthetheirthemthentherethesetheythisthreetimetotootwounderupuseverywalkwantwaswaywewentwerewhatwhenwherewhichwhitewhowillwithwouldwriteyellowyesyouyourWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"KinderGrammar Kindergarten Grammar Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderGrammar-Kindergarten-Grammar-Curriculum-2598315,"KinderGrammar CurriculumKinderGrammar Curriculum is a 20 week or 100 academic day systematic curriculum. KinderGrammar Curriculum covers 20 skill focuses and includes 5 simple “print and teach” lessons per skill. The lessons are scripted for ease of teaching. Each day the students also have exit tickets to match the skill.With the average school year being 30 weeks, this program offers flexibility that you can repeat the lessons more than once or rotate grammar with another pressing area of instruction within your classroom day. KinderGrammar Curriculum lessons are meant to be quick and to the point. The teacher simply introduces or reviews the concepts, build upon the concept from previous lessons, engages the students in a discussion about the skill, requires students to show mastery of the skill, and then allows the students an opportunity for independent practice. How Can I use KinderGrammar in my Class?You can add KinderGrammar into your morning routine, reading block, writing block, or any other time of the day that you have about 10 minutes of instruction time. KinderGrammar also offers suggestions for extension in each of the skill focuses. KinderGrammar pairs the KinderLiteracy weeks to each of the skills and also offers additional extensions for those with/without KinderLiteracy texts. If you do not have a long period of time for the lessons you can choose to eliminate the daily practice sheet or do it whole-group as well.Tell me more about ""fitting"" KinderGrammar in... KinderGrammar is designed to be a quick and efficient whole-group lesson. The lesson itself can range from 10 minutes and upward according to how much you would like to expand it. Each day the students also have an optional independent sheet. You can choose a time within your day that allows you the optimum opportunity for the lessons. Also, note that there are 20 weeks of instruction. It's possible that you rotate a week on of grammar and a week off. Grammar is a vital part of our instruction that in a lot of cases has fallen ""off the grid."" KinderGrammar allows you the opportunity to bring it back with the ease and efficiency of each lesson!What Skills Are Included in KinderGrammar?Nouns Verbs Adjectives Sentence Part: Subject Sentence Part: Verb Complete Sentence Proper Nouns Pronouns Plural Nouns Prepositions Statements Exclamations Questions Multiple MeaningVerbs (Future)Verbs (Present)Verbs (Past)Verbs (All tenses)Shades of MeaningContractionsBe sure to view the preview to see a sample lesson!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"KinderLifeSkills: Life Skills Curriculum Kindergarten, Preschool, Pre-K, TK, JK",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderLifeSkills-Life-Skills-Curriculum-Kindergarten-Preschool-Pre-K-TK-JK-3947511,"KinderLifeSkills Kindergarten Life Skills: A life skills curriculum for primary-aged students! This packet is designed for the kindergarten classroom and easily adapted to fit a guardian-led homeschool setting! If inquiring about this bundle for a homeschool setting, feel free to email me directly with any questions at tara@littlemindsatwork.org! What is KinderLifeSkills?KinderLifeSkills Curriculum is an engaging life skills curriculum with young learners in mind! KinderLifeSkills takes 75 common life skills and teaches them in a kid-friendly way for students. The students are able to grow and develop by listening to the oral stories. The oral stories contain a character, Levi the Life Skills Lion. Levi will take the students on adventures as they are introduced to the broad life skills context.What is the structure of KinderLifeSkills?KinderLifeSkills consists of 75 two-day lesson plans. Day one is an introduction of the skill and an oral story. Day two is a review of the skill and a hands-on approach to applying the skill. On the second day the students are also asked to deeply think and apply the skill to their own lives. On both days the students will interact with their peers through verbal discussions. The teacher will lead the initial conversation and then turn it over to the students for their opportunity to have collaborative peer discussion. KinderLifeSkills also includes a follow-up independent writing sheet for each skill. This is a way for the students to put the skill on paper and for parents to be connected with the skill of the day. There is a note at the bottom of each paper so parents can track the life skill and hopefully continue the discussion of that skill at home.What is included in KinderLifeSkills?- 150 life skill lessons (75 skills spanning over 2 days each) *day one is an oral story and day two is follow-up) - 75 follow-up student sheets (2 differentiated versions included for non-writers and writers)- lion ""puppet""- notebook labels- journal coversWhat does the RESEARCH say about KinderLifeSkills?In the day and age of increased academic competence in children from preschool age through high school, there also seems to be a decrease in the emphasis on life skills. All too often we read article after article to support the fact that there is an extremely high need in providing students with the life skills they so desperately need to be successful in today’s society. Currently education identifies core curricula as language arts, math, science, and social studies. However, Dr. Spencer Kagan, a world renowned author and keynote speaker in the fields of both education and psychology, points out that life skills are just as important in an educational setting as the other core curricula and should be treated as such. Dr. Kagan (2003) points out that compared to previous generations, students today come to school lacking many basic life skills, including social, emotional, organizational and citizenship skills. Although there are many factors that have contributed to this decline, he points out that once these students grow up, they will need these skills in a work force that is now placing a greater emphasis on teamwork and interdependence. Dr. Kagan’s resolution to this crisis is for students to be exposed to a comprehensive life skills curriculum that will address these deficits.What skills are included in KinderLifelSkills?Story 1: Using a NapkinStory 2: Tying ShoesStory 3: Eating UtensilStory 4: Eating with HandsStory 5: HandwashingStory 6: Bathroom EtiquetteStory 7: Toilets and UrinalsStory 8: Buttoning PantsStory 9: ZippingStory 10: Buckles and Tucking In ShirtsStory 11: Putting on CoatStory 12: Blowing NoseStory 13: Nose PickingStory 14: SneezingStory 15: LickingStory 16: Checking Face in MirrorStory 17: Phone NumberStory 18: AddressStory 19: Opening Milk CartonStory 20: Zipping BaggiesStory 21: Trying New FoodsStory 22: Greeting GuestsStory 23: Getting Someone's AttentionStory 24: Saying Excuse MeStory 25: Please and Thank YouStory 26: Hand SanitizerStory 27: Caring for School SuppliesStory 28: Being WastefulStory 29: Picking UpStory 30: Being a HelperStory 31: Wiping Off Feet at the DoorStory 32: Knocking Off Snow at the DoorStory 33: MannersStory 34: Lining Up PolitelyStory 35: Doing the Right ThingStory 36: Thinking of OthersStory 37: Soap Squirts UsageStory 38: Power Towel UsageStory 39: The Drinking FountainStory 40: Responsible for ItemsStory 41: Happy for OthersStory 42: Introducing OneselfStory 43: Being a LeaderStory 44: Actively ListeningStory 45: Chewing on ClothesStory 46: Entering a RoomStory 47: Putting Things in a FolderStory 48: Table MannersStory 49: ""Finders, Keepers""Story 50: Responding to an AdultStory 51: Latch a Bathroom StallStory 52: Pushing in ChairsStory 53: Hugs and KissesStory 54: Ordering LunchStory 55: Responding to GriefStory 56: Making a 911 CallStory 57: Bicycle SafetyStory 58: Seat BeltsStory 59: Taking Others' ThingsStory 60: Being IndependentStory 61: Stopping When AskedStory 62: Stranger SafetyStory 63: Crossing a StreetStory 64: Knowing School DetailsStory 65: Healthy EatingStory 66: Hair, Teeth, NailsStory 67: Limiting TV TimeStory 68: Protection From IllnessStory 69: Inside-Out ClothingStory 70: Pulling Up SleevesStory 71: Rude, Mean, BulliesStory 72: Stop, Drop, RollStory 73: Telling the TruthStory 74: Building TrustStory 75: Personal Information*Please note that the stories may be used in any order you choose!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/Sped?You will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate covers. Is KinderLifeSkills a lot of prep?This unit is a quick and simple prep! You will need to decide first if you choose to place all of the lessons on one single book ring or two separate book rings. Your next decision will be to print out the kindergarten specific covers or the generic grade covers. Print out your covers and then print out the 75 pages of lesson plan cards. Each page will have two days of lesson plans. Once the lesson cards are printed out, you will then trim around the edges and cut away the extra white paper. Next, you will need to hole punch each of the lesson cards. Place the cards onto the book ring(s) and you are good to go. You can place the student response sheets in a teacher master binder or make student journals. Laminating the lesson cards is optional. Printing the lesson cards on cardstock is recommended for durability.Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

This curriculum was designed to include the best practices for the Science of Reading. The unit was heavily researched and vetted by a team of educators. The Guided Phonics + Beyond Curriculum is designed to include all needed material to lead your whole-group phonics block and your small-group learning block. Each lesson plan has designated components and routines for both whole-group learning and small-group learning. The program includes a scope and sequence. This scope and sequence can be applied to any time frame. You can teach a new lesson every day, a new lesson every two days, and so on. Adjust the units to fit your students at that moment in time. In Unit 2: CVC Words, students will progress through the alphabet a second time. Students will learn letters the second time through in an order that lends itself to building and reading words right away. Let’s get started on this journey!This units includes 25 lessons (each lesson includes material for 2 days so this unit can last 25-50 academic days). The letter sound are reviewed and students begin to build, write, and read CVC words.

If you have a question about a particular standard, please send me an email! Tell me more! What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of Pre-K Literacy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The Pre-K Literacy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with Pre-K Literacy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. Pre-K Literacy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of Pre-K Literacy, the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a Pre-K Literacy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In Pre-K Literacy, these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a retelling, project or discussion. Phonemic Awareness instruction for Pre-K Literacy: Why is that important? “Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the Pre-K Literacy lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Please view the preview to see the unit pictures and necessary books!Would you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

If inquiring about this bundle for a homeschool setting, feel free to email me directly with any questions at tara@littlemindsatwork.org!What is FirstieLiteracy®?FirstieLiteracy® units are based upon the close read model and is a whole-group reading curriculum. With this program you will not need to supplement another whole-group reading program. Each week you will focus on one text and each day look closely at that text.

As the units progress the students will annotate articles by marking evidence, unknown words, story elements, confusing sections of the story, character traits, and so much more. FirstieLiteracy units focus on the close reading lesson for the week and phonemic awareness. It does not have the writing or poetry component like KinderLiteracy®.Tell me more! What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of FirstieLiteracy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The FirstieLiteracy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with FirstieLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. FirstieLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of FirstieLiteracy , the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a FirstieLiteracy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In FirstieLiteracy , these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions. Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of FirstieLiteracy involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Phonemic Awareness instruction for Kindergarten and First Grade Lessons: Why is that important? “Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the K and 1st lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Do you teach kindergarten?

ALL OF THE DAY ONE STORIES ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN A GOOGLE SLIDES VERSION ALONG WITH THE PRINTABLES! >>> VIEW A PREVIEW VIDEO OF THE GOOGLE VERSION HERE <<< This is an all *NEW* packet of social skills stories! This has all new 75 lessons and follow-up sheets! Set two was created when teachers asked for even MORE stories! What is KinderSocialSkills?KinderSocialSkills Curriculum is an engaging social skills curriculum with young learners in mind! KinderSocialSkills takes 75 common social skills and teaches them in a kid-friendly way for students. The students are able to grow and develop by listening to the social stories. The social stories contain two main characters, Tom Cat and Tabby Cat. The two cats will take the students on adventures as they are introduced to the broad social skills context through both home and school settings.What is the structure of KinderSocialSkills?KinderSocialSkills consists of 75 two-day lesson plans. Day one is an introduction of the skill and a social story. Day two is a review of the skill and a hands-on approach to applying the skill. On the second day the students are also asked to deeply think and apply the skill to their own lives. On both days the students will interact with their peers through verbal discussions. The teacher will lead the initial conversation and then turn it over to the students for their opportunity to have collaborative peer discussion. KinderSocialSkills also includes a follow-up independent writing sheet for each skill. This is a way for the students to put the skill on paper and for parents to be connected with the skill of the day. There is a note at the bottom of each paper so parents can track the social skill and hopefully continue the discussion of that skill at home.What is included in KinderSocialSkills?- 150 social skill lessons (75 skills spanning over 2 days each) *day one is a social story and day two is follow-up) - 75 follow-up student sheets (2 differentiated versions included for non-writers and writers)- paper clip art cat ""puppets""- notebook labels- journal coversWhat does the RESEARCH say about KinderSocialSkills?Research shows us social skills are at times a bigger indicator for future success in life than academics (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2015). That statement is profound. A longitudinal study regarding kindergarten students and social skills was conducted by Drs. Damon Jones and Mark Greenberg, both professors at Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Max Crowley, a professor from Duke University. The kindergarten students were tracked over a 20 year period and the results were astonishing. The predictions made in kindergarten based upon their social skills had a direct correlation with outcomes met in mid-adulthood and later adulthood. The study showed that utilizing social emotional health programs at a young age can help to improve these social skills. Furthermore, when students are given an opportunity to learn social skills, educators and parents are given the ability to notice those lacking these social skills and then set up immediate and intense interventions to correct this disconnect. The researchers believed that social skills are just as vital in the kindergarten classroom as academics. What skills are included in KinderSocialSkills?Story 1: Taking TurnsStory 2: Following directionsStory 3: Following rulesStory 4: SharingStory 5: Being a good friendStory 6: Impulse controlStory 7: Voice volumeStory 8: TattlingStory 9: Being first and lastStory 10: InterruptingStory 11: Personal spaceStory 12: Asking for helpStory 13: ApologizingStory 14: HelpingStory 15: Praising othersStory 16: Good sportsmanshipStory 17: PatienceStory 18: CompromisingStory 19: Respecting othersStory 20: Eye contactStory 21: Identifying feelingsStory 22: Expressing feelingsStory 23: EncouragementStory 24: ComplimentingStory 25: Communicating clearlyStory 26: Expected behaviorStory 27: Think before you speakStory 28: Peer pressureStory 29: Problem solvingStory 30: MannersStory 31: Being flexibleStory 32: Accepting ""no""Story 33: Accepting criticismStory 34: Celebrating successStory 35: Asking permissionStory 36: ParticipationStory 37: Staying on taskStory 38: Using namesStory 39: Conflict resolutionStory 40: CooperationStory 41: ForgivingStory 42: ReliabilityStory 43:TrustStory 44: Initiating a conversationStory 45: Holding a conversationStory 46: Ending a conversationStory 47: ResponsibilityStory 48: Respecting yourselfStory 49: Respect propertyStory 50: Respect othersStory 51: Respect authorityStory 52: Facial expressionsStory 53: Body languageStory 54: HonestyStory 55: PerseveranceStory 56: Making mistakesStory 57: Best effortStory 58: Avoiding conflictsStory 59: Accepting differencesStory 60: ConfidenceStory 61: Actions impacting othersStory 62: Self-esteemStory 63: Being bossyStory 64: Being positiveStory 65: Calming downStory 66: Making decisionsStory 67: Knowing strengthsStory 68: Knowing weaknessesStory 69: Multiple friendsStory 70: GratitudeStory 71: Sore loserStory 72: ControlStory 73: GuiltStory 74: Giving CriticismStory 75: Separation *Please note that the stories may be used in any order you choose!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/Sped?You will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate covers. Is KinderSocialSkills a lot of prep?This unit is a quick and simple prep! You will need to decide first if you choose to place all of the lessons on one single book ring or two separate book rings. Your next decision will be to print out the kindergarten specific covers or the generic grade covers. Print out your covers and then print out the 75 pages of lesson plan cards. Each page will have two days of lesson plans. Once the lesson cards are printed out, you will then trim around the edges and cut away the extra white paper. Next, you will need to hole punch each of the lesson cards. Place the cards onto the book ring(s) and you are good to go. You can place the student response sheets in a teacher master binder or make student journals. Laminating the lesson cards is optional. Printing the lesson cards on cardstock is recommended for durability.View KinderSocialSkills Version ONE here!

The lesson plan has the listed objective, “I can” statement, vocabulary, detailed activity lesson plans and all necessary student follow-up practice sheets. 2nd Grade Social Studies encourages a daily routine, but please know that as the teacher you can adjust the lessons and make them best work for your daily schedule and time allotment. Within each lesson the students will partake in a quick lesson opener, whole-group skill lesson and the students will take part in a follow-up task. Please note that all student follow-up practice sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student journal. You can also choose to have students track their daily activities in their journal with or without the included response sheets. What is included?- 2 weeks of lesson plans per unit (10 days of instruction)- Daily printable practice sheets - Vocabulary Cards- *Whiteboard* Books (1-2 books per unit)- Journal labels- Necessary cards/teaching add-ons- Crafts and SO much more (view the preview)Let's Take a Look at the Lessons!Unit 1: Democracy and GovernmentUnit 1- Lesson 1: CitizensUnit 1- Lesson 2: American SymbolsUnit 1- Lesson 3: Bill of RightsUnit 1- Lesson 4: Citizen ResponsibilitiesUnit 1- Lesson 5: LawsUnit 1- Lesson 6: DemocracyUnit 1- Lesson 7: Branches of GovernmentUnit 1- Lesson 8: Government OfficialsUnit 1- Lesson 9: The PresidentUnit 1- Lesson 10: VotingWhat about the standards?

"KinderWordBuilding® Kindergarten Word Building Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderWordBuilding-Kindergarten-Word-Building-Intervention-Curriculum-2313764,"KinderWordBuilding® CurriculumKinderWordBuilding® is a very versatile intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, whole-group phonics, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. KinderWordBuilding® is broken down into four major areas; word building, word writing, reading fluency, and sight fluency. For word building all students participating in the program will need access to magnetic letters. You can find those online and in teacher resources stores. Students will also need a magnetic surface like a whiteboard or magnetic cookie sheet. For word and sentence writing students will need their own writing journal which has been included within the unit. Reading fluency will be accomplished through the included interactive whiteboard sentence files and/or through the blackline sentences. Lastly, sight fluency will be conducted during transitional periods of your lesson using the included fluency cards.Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. However, a sample whole-group KinderWordBuilding® lesson could look like this; students meet at the carpet, students retrieve their letter boards, teacher gives students the first word to build, students build word, students verify their words by viewing the teachers interactive letter board {included in the unit}, students clear their board, students build and check remaining words, students place their boards away and retrieve their journals, teacher prompts students to write each word into their journal, students do so then verify the accuracy of the word by using the teacher’s interactive journal, students write and check sentence, students place journals away and sit at carpet, students read interactive fluency sentences, students read fluency cards, teacher wraps up lesson.If using this program as a whole-group intervention you can look into splitting up your grade level students into different groups based upon their current level. All students should progress through the program from start to finish without skipping any levels. This will guarantee that students are confident in the skill. All students will take assessments to progress to the next level. If students are not ready to progress then the teacher can use the editable plans to add additional words for that skill. If the students are succeeding at an abnormal rate then the teacher can speed up the lesson. However, it should be noted that the highest success comes from using the program with fidelity and not skipping any steps unless necessary for time constraints.What is included in KinderWordBuilding®?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans for 100 instructional days. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans. -Fluency cards-Fluency sentences and interactive slides-Interactive magnetic alphabet for teacher use*Students will need access to their own set of magnetic lettersSkills Covered in KinderWordBuilding®KinderWordBuilding® is designed for a 115 day curriculum. There are 100 days of lessons and 15 additional days for assessment. KinderWordBuilding® is not a full academic year of instruction because it is implied that KinderWordBuilding® would not start until students have an understanding of letter names and letter sounds.

"KinderSocialSkills: Social Skills Easy Readers",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderSocialSkills-Social-Skills-Easy-Readers-3699435,"KinderSocialSkills Easy Readers- a set of 300 books covering 75 social skills topics! What are KinderSocialSkills Easy Readers?KinderSocialSkills easy readers take 75 common social skills and teaches them in a kid-friendly way for students. The students are able to grow and develop by reading the social stories. The social stories contain two main characters, Tom Cat and Tabby Cat. The two cats will take the students on adventures as they are introduced to the broad social skills context through school settings.KinderSocialSkills easy readers consist of 75 books. Each of the 75 readers come in four levels (A-D). At the back of each easy reader, is an included comprehension check.What is included in KinderSocialSkills?- 300 easy readers (75 skills and 4 levels of each book A-D)- Grayscale books included-FREE BONUS! Interactive books added!What does the RESEARCH say about KinderSocialSkills?Research shows us social skills are at times a bigger indicator for future success in life than academics (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2015). That statement is profound. A longitudinal study regarding kindergarten students and social skills was conducted by Drs. Damon Jones and Mark Greenberg, both professors at Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Max Crowley, a professor from Duke University. The kindergarten students were tracked over a 20 year period and the results were astonishing. The predictions made in kindergarten based upon their social skills had a direct correlation with outcomes met in mid-adulthood and later adulthood. The study showed that utilizing social emotional health programs at a young age can help to improve these social skills. Furthermore, when students are given an opportunity to learn social skills, educators and parents are given the ability to notice those lacking these social skills and then set up immediate and intense interventions to correct this disconnect. The researchers believed that social skills are just as vital in the kindergarten classroom as academics.

This bundle is like no other high frequency bundle as it's 100% SOR aligned. Each unit has a high frequency word (HFW) scope & sequence that is based on PHONICS. Words will be paired/taught/practiced that have common phonics patterns. This program will cover decodable HFWs and irregular/heart HFWs. Please view this THIS scope to see the 260 words covered!OVERVIEW VIDEO HERE!* * * Questions? Click HERE to Instant Message me! * * *The high frequency word printables and centers bundle is aligned to the Guided Phonics + Beyond Curriculum. The Guided Phonics + Beyond Curriculum was written with special detail to every lesson and every included component. The curriculum was designed to include the best practices for the Science of Reading. These aligned printables and mats will offer teachers using the Guided Phonics + Beyond Curriculum, an aligned component to use for independent workers during the small-group block or whole-group block. However, it should be noted that a teacher does not need to follow the Guided Phonics + Beyond Curriculum with fidelity in order to use these activities. Each activity is noted with the Guided Phonics + Beyond lesson number it pairs with. The activities are designed with visual appeal yet with a clear and concise educational skill focus. All activities include a matching “I can” card to hold students accountable for their independent studies. The activities included come with a variety of hands-on center mats and printable practice. These activities can be used for whole-group instruction, morning work, early finishers, for your small-group instruction, sent home for homework, and of course for independent literacy centers.INCLUDED PACKETS: UNIT 2 High Frequency Words Units (INCLUDED NOW) *$9 value*UNIT 3 High Frequency Words Units (INCLUDED NOW) *$9 value*UNIT 4 High Frequency Words Units (INCLUDED NOW) *$9 value*UNIT 5 High Frequency Words Unit (INCLUDED NOW) *$9 value*UNIT 6 High Frequency Words Unit (INCLUDED NOW) *$9 value*Please view this THIS scope to see the 260 high frequency words covered in this bundle!WHAT IS INCLUDED: 1,000 HIGH FREQUENCY WORD PRINTABLES (200 per 5 units= 1,000)375 HIGH FREQUENCY WORD CENTER MATS (75 per units= 375)5 Write the Room HIGH FREQUENCY WORD Centers (1 per 5 units)INCLUDED ACTIVITIES: 1.

"KinderSTEM: Kindergarten STEM Curriculum Bundle","$25.00Price $25.00","Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderSTEM-Kindergarten-STEM-Curriculum-Bundle-2639970,"Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum Bundle Thanks so much for viewing my Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum units bundled. Kinder/FirstieSTEMCurriculum is an engaging STEM curriculum with young learners in mind! Kinder/FirstieSTEM is standards-based and encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. What is STEM?STEM is the integration (not singular practice) of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math in an active environment that focuses on student-centered learning. Students are engaged in discovering problems, questioning, problem solving, collaborating, and hands on activities while they face real world issues. Students are encouraged to approach the problem based upon their previous learning. Everyone’s voice matters, all ideas matter and are discussed and attempted. Students evaluate their approach and solution throughout the STEM activity and improve their design as they build and experiment. Teachers are facilitators of thinking and guide students through the problem solving experience. What Units Are Included in Kinder/FirstieSTEMKinder/FirstieSTEM is based upon five units: Motion and Gravity, Rocks and Soil, Changes in Water, Plant/Animal Needs, and States of Matter. Each unit is broken down into five to seven lessons. ** However, please note that each lesson can take several academic days to complete. Each lesson has the standards covered, materials list, lesson vocabulary, STEM design loop integration, detailed activity lesson plans, and all necessary student recording sheets. The units also includes “action” photos, vocabulary cards, parent unit overview letter, parent involvement request slips, STEM design loop, and all other necessary supplies. The lessons will at times suggest the integration of online book sources and online video databases to engage the learners into the unit topic. Please note that all student response sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student STEM journal. You can also choose to have students track their daily STEM activities in their STEM journal with or without the included response sheets.Kinder/FirstieSTEM is a Growing Bundle!Unit One: Gravity and Motion INCLUDED Unit Two: Rocks and Soil INCLUDED Unit Three: Changes in Water INCLUDED Unit Four: Plant and Animal Needs INCLUDED Unit Five: States of Matter INCLUDED Overview of Units:Gravity and Motion- During this unit of study, the students will explore motion through understandings of the effects of push, pull, gravity, and force on objects. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create ramps and tracks. Students will be presented with a problem, imagine the possibilities to create a structure, plan the resources they will use, and create a track together in a small group. By the end of this unit, students will understand the STEM design loop and will be able to communicate their understanding of the effects of motion and gravity on an object. Rocks and Soil- During this unit of study, the students will explore rocks and soil through understandings of weathering, erosion, comparing, contrasting, sorting, using their senses to observe and building their understanding of how rocks and soil effect the world around them. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create sifters to help sort rocks and soil. Plant and Animal Needs- In this STEM unit, student will be learning all about the basic needs of plants and animals, will be able to identify plant parts, and will be able to compare and describe various animals. Students will create a habitat for a rainforest animal that will meet their basic needs based on classroom learning. States of Matter- During this unit, the students will identify and experiment with the properties of solids, liquids, and gases. In addition, students will explore the various types of physical changes. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create play dough.Changes in Water- Students will identify and experiment with the water cycle, different stages of water (solid, liquid, gas) and weight of water before and after freezing. The student engineers will use the knowledge they have gained from this unit to create an icehouse. Once the icehouse is made from various materials, each team of engineers will test their icehouses to see if it slows the rate of ice melting compared the uncovered ice cube (constant). This design challenge will allow the students to investigate and demonstrate their understanding of the basic properties of frozen and liquid water What About Standards?The units are based upon commonly phrases state science standards as well as the Next Generation Science Standards! Within the units you'll see those commonly used phrases of science power standards across state to state. Below are additional NGSS!Unit 1: K-PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and interactions, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 2: K-PS3 Energy, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 3: K-ESS2 Earth’s Systems, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 4: K-LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 5: K-2-ETS1-2. Develop a simple sketch, drawing, or physical model to illustrate how the shape of an object helps it functionas needed to solve a given problem. Why STEM is important?According to the U.S. Department of Education, all STEM jobs in the U.S. will increase 14 percent from 2010-2020, accounting for millions of positions. Yet many will go unfilled, as students are not prepared for an occupation in this field. We can change this, we must change this. Using a STEM approach in teaching allows students to apply learning that occurred in the four subject areas to a real life problem given by the teacher. Students are able to problem solve in a way that the typical classroom learning does not allow. STEM capitalizes on students’ interests and experiences, builds on what they know and have just learned, and provides them an opportunity to take chances and engage in learning in a different way. Using a STEM model prepares students to investigate questions they have about the world they live in and gives them the tools to solve daily problems they encounter. A STEM enriched classroom sounds different as well; students are conversing, sharing ideas, discussing possibilities, and using learned vocabulary as they experiment together. As educators, our job is to teach, create compelling learning environments that foster learning for our students, and prepare them to be college, career, and life ready. The use of vocabulary, hands on approach, and collaboration that occurs during these STEM lessons amazes me as a teacher. Some of my students who struggle with reading or math facts excel in STEM lessons. Their confidence builds as their team listens to their ideas; they feel valued and a part of the learning in a way they never have before. These students find new interests, strengths, and set new goals for their future. I learn more about my students while observing them solve problems in a STEM setting than I do in any other situation in the classroom.

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of 2nd Grade Literacy Units Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The 2nd Grade Literacy Units close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with FirstieLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. FirstieLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of FirstieLiteracy , the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a 2nd Grade Literacy Units text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In FirstieLiteracy , these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions. Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of 2nd Grade Literacy Units involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Do you teach first grade?

The units cover at least two weeks of instruction. Each lesson plan has the listed objective, “I can” statement, vocabulary, detailed activity lesson plans and all necessary student follow-up practice sheets. KinderSocialStudies encourages a daily routine, but please know that as the teacher you can adjust the lessons and make them work best for your daily schedule and time allotment. Within each lesson the students will partake in a quick lesson opener, whole-group skill lesson, and a follow-up task. Please note that all student follow-up practice sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student journal. All of the follow-up sheets are also differentiated so that you can use these units anytime during the school year, and they will be applicable to your writers or nonwriters.

This unit has been based upon the compilation of many state standards. Those state standards were cross-checked to verify the most common occurring standards. If the strand appeared in first grade, the first grade standard was met within the unit as well.

This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this!

"KinderTales and Beyond: PreK & Kindergarten Nursery Rhymes and Fables",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderTales-and-Beyond-PreK-Kindergarten-Nursery-Rhymes-and-Fables-2892663,"What is KinderTales and Beyond? Thanks so much for viewing my new packet, KinderTales and Beyond! One word to the wise right away is that this packet is not JUST for kindergarten student. This packet would be great for those that teach nursery rhymes and fables, especially that of Pre-K. KinderTales and Beyond is a 4 week program. First, the students will partake in two weeks of instruction in nursery rhymes. The students will be introduced to ten nursery rhymes or one per day. You can also choose to spend more than one day on that nursery rhyme. That would allow the units to expand even further. The next two weeks are for covering fables. The students will learn two new fables each wee or a total of four fables. During the daily instruction the students will be asked to analyze the stories, answer questions about: characters, setting, theme, moral, and sequence of events. What is included? The units include crafts, vocabulary cards, retell cards, student blacklines, and more! Each week you will have all necessary material included. The only material you might want to grab would be these two texts: Nursery Rhymes from Mother Goose by Scott Gustafson and The Classic Treasury of Aesop's Fables by Don Daily. However, if you have the nursery rhymes or fables in an alternate format then no other items are needed. What nursery rhymes are covered? Jack and Jill Mary Had a Little LambHey Diddle DiddleLittle Bo PeepHickory DickoryLittle Miss MuffetBaa, Baa Black SheepHumpty DumptyItsy Bitsy SpiderJack Be Nimble What fables are covered? The Tortoise and the HareThe Lion and the MouseThe Goose Who Laid Golden EggsThe Dog and His Reflection Can I see more? Yes! Be sure to view the HUGE preview! You will be able to see a snippet of the lesson plans and materials included! Please note that there is a LOT more included! Is this part of any other bundle and do I need this? This packet is not part of any other bundle (KinderLiteracy). I made that decision as KinderLiteracy is already well beyond the 35 weeks that were promised. I would also like to keep this packet seperate for the Pre-K teachers that have asked for something on their end! Do you need this packet? That is of course your decision! I feel this packet is perfect to split it up these two ways: two weeks of nursery rhymes at the beginning of the school year and two weeks of fables anytime you see fit! I know that Texas teachers are asked to teach fables which is why I orginally made this packet! Do you have questions?

Will this work for my class? Well, that is a little hard for me to answer because of the varying levels of students. I suggest that you view the preview to see if it could work! The close read is certainly Prek and 1st grade acceptable! The math skills and phonics could be adjusted to fit 1st grade as well! The memory book does include a version that is generic for any grade level! I like to make sure my products are 100% appropriate for a single grade instead of stretching them over several grade levels which can make them diluted.Be sure to view the preview to see more of the packet!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"Second Grade Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Second-Grade-Intervention-Curriculum-2589830,"Second Grade Intervention Curriculum2nd Grade Intervention Curriculum is a very versatile intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, whole-group phonics, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. 2nd Grade Intervention Curriculum is broken down into four major areas; word building, word writing, reading fluency, and sight word fluency. For word building all students participating in the program will need access to magnetic letters. You can find those online and in teacher resources stores. Students will also need a magnetic surface like a whiteboard or magnetic cookie sheet. Teachers have also had success using magnet apps on tablets and iPads. For word and sentence writing students will need their own writing journal which has been included within the unit. Reading fluency will be accomplished through the included interactive whiteboard sentence files and/or through the blackline sentences. Lastly, sight word fluency will be conducted during transitional periods of your lesson using the included fluency cards.Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. However, a sample whole-group 2nd Grade Intervention lesson could look like this: students meet at the carpet, students retrieve their letter boards, teacher gives students the first word to build, students build word, students verify their words by viewing the teachers interactive letter board {included in the unit}, students clear their board, students build and check remaining words, students place their boards away and retrieve their journals, teacher prompts students to write each word into their journal, students do so then verify the accuracy of the word by using the teacher’s interactive journal, students write and check sentence, students place journals away and sit at carpet, students read interactive fluency sentences, students read fluency cards, teacher wraps up lesson. Please note at anytime you can choose to repeat a week multiple times until your students mastered the skills.If using this program as a whole-group intervention you can look into splitting up your grade level students into different groups based upon their current level. All students should progress through the program from start to finish without skipping any levels. This will guarantee that students are confident in the skill. All students will take assessments to progress to the next level. If students are not ready to progress then the teacher can use the editable plans to add additional words for that skill. If the students are succeeding at an abnormal rate then the teacher can speed up the lesson. However, it should be noted that the highest success comes from using the program with fidelity and not skipping any steps unless necessary for time constraints.What is included in Second Grade Intervention Curriculum?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans for 150 instructional days. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans. -Fluency cards-Fluency sentences, fluency skill builder sheets, and interactive slides-Interactive magnetic alphabet file for teacher use*Students will need access to their own set of magnetic lettersSkills Covered in Second Grade Intervention 2nd Grade Intervention is designed for a 150 day curriculum.

Save BIG when you purchase the KinderWriting® BUNDLED units. View the B U N D L E here!What is KinderWriting®?KinderWriting® Curriculum is an engaging, kindergarten, genre-based writing curriculum. KinderWriting® encourages young learners to look inward at their endless possibilities as a writer. KinderWriting® is based upon nine units: Writing With Pictures, Writing With Sentences, Writing With Stories, Writing With Narrative, Writing With Opinion, Writing With Direction, Writing With Persuasion, Writing With Imagination, and Writing With Information. Each unit is broken down to 20 lessons. The units cover 20 days of academic instruction. The lesson plans have listed unit objectives, “I can” statements, Common Core writing standards and needed mentor texts. KinderWriting encourages a daily routine of a minilesson, independent writing, and a share time. Each of the lessons in KinderWriting are well thought out for the young writer and spiral back to previous lessons to ensure students are retaining their skills. KinderWriting also includes unit anchor charts, a variety of writing paper, conferring schedules and note sheets, sample writings, student writing goals display, writing rubrics, and step-by-step guides that are made specifically for each unit. What is included in KinderWritring Curriculum?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do.

Each unit has a focus standard that is based upon the Common Core Standards. Units further into the year will have more than one focus standard. If you teach to a varying set of standards, you can email me for assistance. Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

"KinderMath®: Kindergarten Math Think and Talk",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderMath-Kindergarten-Math-Think-and-Talk-3287796,"KinderMath®: Think and Talk: A supplemental program for the primary classroom.Do you have a few extra moments? LISTEN and WATCH more about KinderMath: Think and Talk HERE!What is KinderMath®: Think and Talk?KinderMath®: Think and Talk is a supplemental curriculum that can be used to boost any current math curriculum in the classroom! The program is designed to give primary students a way to talk about math through the use of images. Students will also have an opportunity to learn math skills in a hands-on and meaningful way. You can find success through using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, or as a resource for non-certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted fifteen minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. KinderMath®: Think and Talk is created by a teacher for teachers. The program has been carefully created and organized to align with every classroom and curriculum. The lessons can be introduced in any order the teacher chooses. That makes this program available to all teachers that have the desire to boost their math instruction.Tell me more about KinderMath®: Think and Talk! KinderMath: Think and Talk offers six days of instruction per unit. Each day the students will start the day’s lesson by looking at a fiction or realistic image. The teacher will then guide the students through the math lesson and offer students an opportunity to discuss and evaluate the image. Students will then apply their knowledge in a hands-on and meaningful way. Included within each unit are hands-on and concrete ways to apply the skill along with one practice sheet per image. What are Think and Talk Images?The use of realistic images throughout the units allows students to see math as “real life.” They see the images in a natural way and can then apply that same way of thinking to their everyday lives. As we guide students through the Think and Talk lessons, we really want to offer them what the product’s title states: time to think and time to talk. It’s important that when we present one of the images to the students, we truly encourage them to take their time and really study the image. We then want to give students time to turn and talk with their peers. This will give students a way to verbalize what they saw and learn new ways of thinking from their peers. It’s important that the students have an understanding that the images may have more than one answer and that it’s okay. After the initial conversation regarding the image, teachers are encouraged to prompt students for a follow-up discussion. What knowledge did we gain from this image? How might we see this in our everyday lives? We want to encourage students to be aware of math all around them and to truly enjoy talking about math.What is included in KinderMath: Think and Talk?- 15 lesson plans (6 days each so a total of 90 days of instruction)- 30 think and talk images (1 realistic and 1 fiction per unit)- 2 practice sheets per unit (30 total)- Applied concrete hands-on ideas per image What skills are covered in KinderMath: Think and Talk?Unit One:Numbers 0-5 Unit Two: Sort and ClassifyUnit Three: Numbers to 10 Unit Four: Compare Numbers to 10 Unit Five: Measurement Unit Six: Numbers 10-20Unit Seven: 2D and 3D Shapes Unit Eight: Numbers to 100 Unit Nine: Comparing Sets Unit Ten: Addition to 10 Unit Eleven: Addition Word Problems Unit Twelve: Subtraction to 10Unit Thirteen: Graphing Unit Fourteen: Time to the Hour Unit Fifteen: Money Values What is KinderMath?KinderMath is a complete and comprehensive math curriculum.

"KinderStart® Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderStart-Curriculum-2514138,"KinderStart® CurriculumHave you found yourself those first couple months of kindergarten completed FRAZZLED!? You know your students need the basics {rhyming, single sounds, syllables, alphabet, name work, color words, sentences}, but you are spending hours hunting down engaging activities to teach the skills? Or, you are teaching the skills but you just don't feel like the students are ""getting it?"" KinderStart steps in and covers both of these! KinderStart covers all the above skills and more... most of all KinderStart is systematic and allows for mastery in the skills!KinderStart® is a very versatile 8 week Kindergarten starter curriculum created by a teacher for teachers and contains 40 daily lessons! The program is designed to give kindergarten students an 8 week introduction to skills in the areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, and oral listening. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. You have so many great programs...how/when will YOU use this program?I will use this program the first 8 weeks of school! I will use this program during my school-wide intervention block. We do not switch our students until the 9th week of school so this will be done whole-group and all students will be to benefit! I don't have an intervention block so when can I use it?We know that the beginning of kindergarten is a lot of routines and getting down the ""basics."" This is also true during our small-group time. We don't usually jump right in on day one pulling back reading groups. Instead we build independent stamina and work on skills our students need! You can easily use KinderStart during this time. Spend 10-15 building stamina and then use KinderStart to fill up your remaining small-group block until students have built up their independent stamina!Sounds great! Tell me more! KinderStart is broken down into three major areas: phonemic awareness, phonics, and oral listening/storytelling. For the oral listening/storytelling the teacher will read an included daily script about the adventures of a bulldog. The students will have an opportunity to listen as he goes on his daily adventures. Included in the lesson plans as well are daily follow-up questions. The students will respond to the story they had just heard. In the area of phonemic awareness the students will be introduced to the skills: rhyming {identifying and generating}, syllables, onset/rime, single sounds, segmenting, and blending. The teacher will lead the students in a variety of activities each week to help build mastery in the skill. The lesson plans provide explicit instruction on what games to play and all necessary pieces are included. The students will also have a phonics piece each week. They will work on names, the alphabet, color words, and words in sentences. Please note this is not an explicit alphabet instruction, but a basic introduction to the alphabet and alphabetic skills.Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. However, a sample whole-group KinderStart lesson could look like this; students meet at the carpet, students listen to the Brisket read aloud story {choose to use a stuffed dog or puppet to bring the story to life}, teacher reads read aloud questions and students respond, teacher introduces phonemic awareness skill, students participate in a game/activity that matches the phonemic awareness skill, teacher introduces phonics skill, students participate in a game/activity that matches the phonics skill. What about assessments? Also included in KinderStart is an assessment piece. Included in the packet is a phonemic awareness assessment tool. You can choose to do a pre-assessment and see where your students are in the areas and then a post test after the 8 week curriculum program. This could be done by simply using two pen colors. Ask the students ½ of the questions before starting the program and then ask the student the last ½ of the questions after the curriculum program has ended. You can also choose to give just one post time to ensure students made adequate progress or to note those that did not. Also included is a phonemic awareness tracker so that can quickly mark those that have mastered the skill and note those that have not.What is included in KinderStart?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans for 40 instructional days. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans. They are truly print and teach lesson plans covering the areas of {oral storytelling, phonemic awareness, and phonics}.-All necessary picture cards and poem pieces-All necessary independent follow up sheets-Color home connection piece for color week-Phonemic awareness assessment and trackerSkills Covered in KinderStartWeek 1: Rhyming {Identifying} and NamesWeek 2: Syllables and NamesWeek 3: Onset/Rime and Alphabet Introduction {Abc's}Week 4: Rhyming {Generating} and Letter Sorting {by attribute}Week 5: Single Sounds and Alphabet Games {maniupulating letters}Week 6: Blending and Color WordsWeek 7: Segmenting and Color WordsWeek 8: Segmenting and Words in Sentences I teach PreK ...what about me?

"PrimarySummer Summer School Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/PrimarySummer-Summer-School-Curriculum-3167436,"What is PrimarySummer?Do you have a view spare moments? Watch this detailed explanation video preview HEREHi there and thanks so much viewing my PrimarySummer packet! This is a 4 week packet that is designed with a supplemental summer school program in mind or a 4 week closer to your school year. This program is created for incoming kindergarten students up to incoming second grade students. Why such a large range you ask? The packet has gone to great lengths to offer differentiation at all ends! Nearly every task is offered in a differentiated format. There will pages that apply to your students and possibly pages that do not apply, no worries because duplicate pages are not counted in the total number of packet pages.What does a week of PrimarySummer look like? PrimarySummer is a supplemental summer program that takes students on a fun and exciting adventure. The students will pack their bags and set sail for their 4 weeks of destinations. At each of the four stops, they will be introduced to a nonfiction close read text. These nonfiction NatGeo texts are separate of the packet and will need purchased. (Lizards by Laura Marsh, Cheetahs by Laura Marsh, Sea Turtles by Laura Marsh and Bears by Elizabeth Carney) There are written close read passages included for the older students to read and annotate independently. The younger students will have the close read text read to them as they listen and respond to the text in the close read model: cold read, vocabulary, text-dependent questions, paired text and culminating activity. Along with the close read, the teacher will have access to multiple student close read response sheets, vocabulary cards, poems, writing lesson plans, writing booklets, science experiments, weekly crafts, literacy centers, math centers, travel suitcase craft and journal keepsake and more.What exactly is included in PrimarySummer?* 4 weeks of scripted close read & wriring lesson plans* Vacation “Destination Guides” (Ocean, Mountains, Safari, Rainforest)* 4 written close read passages for readers* 4 sets of vocabulary cards* 4 crafts (sea turtle, bear, lizard, cheetah)* 4 poems with poster and poem strips* 4 “Real-Life” animal labeling activities * Student differentiated labeling sheets* Student differentiation close read printables* Prek phonics printables (letters Tt, Bb, Ll, Cc)* Writing booklets* Can/Have/Are chart pieces* 12 Literacy centers * 8 Math centers* Hands-on experiments* Hands-on crafts* Hands-on experiences* Suitcase keepsake journal/craftWhat else can you tell me about this packet? I would like to sum up again that this packet is for prekinders through incoming second grade students! The major focus of this unit is the three close read themes/vacation destinations that the students will adventure to each week! You will need to purchase the Nat G nonfiction books on the side! If you are wanting to teach this unit right away and don't the books on hand but you do have an interactive whiteboard, you can choose to buy a e book/Kindle version from Amazon! The Kindle versions will load onto a desktop app and display nicely! For example, here is the link to the Sea Turtles book! I would also like to state again that you will see some ""repeat pages"". That simply means that I have offered a sheet in a couple of different ways to reach the largest range of students! Again, I have not priced the packet for all of those pages so you aren't charged for papers you won't use! There are included literacy and math centers! There is one literacy and one math center for prek and the remaining literacy and math centers are for more K going into first and first going into second!More information on the included centers!Ocean ELA: Alphabet, Manipulating Sounds, DigraphsMath: Counting, Addition, Missing AddendsBears ELA: CVC, CVCC, AlphabetMath: Counting, Subtraction, ComparingCheetahs ELA: Alphabet, CVCe, Sentence ReadingMath: Counting, Subtraction, ComparingRainforest ELA: Beginning Sounds, Alphabet, Word FamiliesMath: Subitizing, CountingHave additional questions?

"BASIC Math Centers Bundle","$24.00Price $24.00","Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/BASIC-Math-Centers-Bundle-3447685,"What are the BASIC centers?Have you ever thought, “I wish I had a set of centers that did not need to take precious class time to teach and reteach again. If only there was a set of basic centers that maintained the same systematic routine and just swapped skills!” Well, wait and fret no more! Basic Math Centers is just that! This bundle offers 5 systematic centers: write the room, sort by skill, spin and record, match-ups and game boards! Within each of these 5 systematic centers comes 30 included activities. These activities cover the same set of skills throughout. For example, if your students are working on shapes you can choose activities from the write the room, sort by skill, spin and record, match-ups and game boards packets and have a full set of centers for your students. Let’s say your kids are then ready for addition! You will simply pull the addition version of each and your students will not need to be taught how to play the center because they just learned the concept during the shape centers. This reduces that time of teaching and reteaching completely! You are now able to swap the skill and keep on trucking along! You will be able to use these centers as a supplement to your whole-group lesson and/or as an independent center option. The centers all come in two versions: color and ink saving black/white. Each center also comes with a recording sheet! If you choose to utilize these center recording mats for more than one use, then you’ll want to laminate them or place them into a dry-erase sleeve. Students can use a dry-erase marker or plastic manipulative to indicate their answers.BASIC CENTERS!* NO THEMES so you can use them throughout the year.* Color AND Black/White versions included.* Center stays the same-- skills change/build in rigor through the year.

"KinderHandwriting Kindergarten Handwriting Curriculum Bundle","$25.00Price $25.00","Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderHandwriting-Kindergarten-Handwriting-Curriculum-Bundle-3267976,"What is KinderHandwriting?KinderHandwriting is a systematic and versatile handwriting curriculum that can be used to supplement any current curriculum in the classroom! The program is designed to give primary students a way to practice and master writing the letters of the alphabet in a hands-on and meaningful way. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non-certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted twenty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. KinderHandwriting is created by a teacher for teachers. The program has been carefully created and organized to align with every classroom and curriculum. The letters can be introduced in any order the teacher chooses. That makes this program available to all teachers that have the desire to boost their handwriting instruction.Tell me more about KinderHandwriting! KinderHandwriting offers two days of instruction per capital and lowercase letter. Each day the students will start the day’s lesson with whole-body movements. The teacher will then introduce the day’s letter utilizing the included interactive path of motion slides. Students will then practice the letter in a hands-on and meaningful way. Included are ten ideas for your hands-on handwriting bins. After the hands-on practice, students will apply their knowledge of the letter by practicing the path of motion with a dry-erase marker and handwriting helper board. The handwriting helper is simply printed and placed into a dry erase sleeve. Lastly, students wrap up the day’s lesson by applying their knowledge of the letter on a paper and pencil follow-up sheet. Why is handwriting instruction so important?Handwriting instruction in the primary classroom is not a new concept but it is one that can easily be pushed aside for the more prominent instruction of ELA and mathematics. However, handwriting is a core skill that every student should master. Handwriting is a complex skill engaging cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills simultaneously. It is best learned through direct instruction (Beringner, 2015; Berninger et al. 2006; Hanstra-Bletz and Blote, 1993; Maeland, 1992). KinderHandwriting recognizes the importance of handwriting instruction along with the complex processes that each letter contains. KinderHandwriting breaks down these complex letters into achievable tasks, acceptable for all learners.What is included in KinderHandwriting Part 1?- 52 (2 day) lesson plans *a total of 104 instructional days- 52 interactive letter math of motion files- Handwriting hands-on tubs overview sheets- 6 letter practice sheet per letter (312 total)- Alphabet cards- Handwriting helper writing insertsWhat is included in KinderHandwriting Part Two?- 25 (2 day) lesson plans *a total of 50 instructional days- 25 interactive word letter math of motion files- Handwriting hands-on tubs overview sheet- 2 practice sheets per word- Word cards (2 versions)- Handwriting helper writing insertsWhat words are covered in KinderHandwriting Part Two?sadragvannapcatbedwedbegtensetkidfigtinzipmixcoblogmopdotfoxrubjugyumsuncutWhat is included in KinderHandwriting Part Three?- 25 (2 day) lesson plans *a total of 50 instructional days- 25 interactive word letter math of motion files - Handwriting hands-on tubs overview sheet- 2 practice sheets per word- Word cards (2 versions)- Handwriting helper writing insertsWhat words and sentences are covered in KinderHandwriting Part Three?like- I like dogs.the- I like the cat.see- I see the sun.my- I see my mom.we- We like the rug.she- She is my mom.he- He likes cats.they- They like the bed.can- I can see the rat.you- Can you see me?want- I want a dog.do- I do not like it.have- I have a cat.that- Do you want that?is- That is my mom.look- Look at me play.make- I can make a hat.here- Here is my dad.are- Are you here?come- I want to come.with- Dad is with mom.down- I can go down.off- Can you jump off?be- I can be here.will- She will be here.KinderHandwriting BUNDLED UnitsKinderHandwriting bundle is a three part bundle.

"Firstievention® First Grade Intervention Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Firstievention-First-Grade-Intervention-Curriculum-2361299,"Firstievention® CurriculumFirstievention® is a very versatile intervention curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, whole-group phonics, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. Firstievention® is broken down into four major areas; word building, word writing, reading fluency, and sight fluency. For word building all students participating in the program will need access to magnetic letters. You can find those online and in teacher resources stores. Students will also need a magnetic surface like a whiteboard or magnetic cookie sheet. For word and sentence writing students will need their own writing journal which has been included within the unit. Reading fluency will be accomplished through the included interactive whiteboard sentence files and/or through the blackline sentences. Lastly, sight fluency will be conducted during transitional periods of your lesson using the included fluency cards.Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. However, a sample whole-group Firstievention® lesson could look like this; students meet at the carpet, students retrieve their letter boards, teacher gives students the first word to build, students build word, students verify their words by viewing the teachers interactive letter board {included in the unit}, students clear their board, students build and check remaining words, students place their boards away and retrieve their journals, teacher prompts students to write each word into their journal, students do so then verify the accuracy of the word by using the teacher’s interactive journal, students write and check sentence, students place journals away and sit at carpet, students read interactive fluency sentences, students read fluency cards, teacher wraps up lesson.If using this program as a whole-group intervention you can look into splitting up your grade level students into different groups based upon their current level. All students should progress through the program from start to finish without skipping any levels. This will guarantee that students are confident in the skill. All students will take assessments to progress to the next level. If students are not ready to progress then the teacher can use the editable plans to add additional words for that skill. If the students are succeeding at an abnormal rate then the teacher can speed up the lesson. However, it should be noted that the highest success comes from using the program with fidelity and not skipping any steps unless necessary for time constraints.What is included in Firstievention®?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans for 100 instructional days. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans. -Fluency cards-Fluency sentences, fluency skill builder sheets, and interactive slides-Interactive magnetic alphabet for teacher use*Students will need access to their own set of magnetic lettersSkills Covered in Firstievention™ Firstievention™ is designed for a 115 day curriculum. There are 100 days of lessons and 15 additional days for assessment. Firstievention™ is not a full academic year of instruction because it is implied that Firstievention™ would not start until students have a solid understanding of letters sounds and CVC word build which is found in KinderWordBuilding™ (Kindergarten Intervention).

Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

"BASIC Literacy Centers Bundle","$24.00Price $24.00","Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/BASIC-Literacy-Centers-Bundle-3422575,"What are the BASIC centers?Have you ever thought, “I wish I had a set of centers that did not need to take precious class time to teach and reteach again. If only there was a set of basic centers that maintained the same systematic routine and just swapped skills!” Well, wait and fret no more! Basics Literacy Centers is just that! This bundle offers 5 systematic centers: write the room, sort by skill, spin and record, match-ups and game boards! Within each of these 5 systematic centers comes 30 included activities. These activities cover the same set of skills throughout. For example, if your students are working on CVC words you can choose activities from the write the room, sort by skill, spin and record, match-ups and game boards packets and have a full set of centers for your students. Let’s say your kids are then ready for digraphs! You will simply pull the digraph version of each and your students will not need to be taught how to play the center because they just learned the concept during the CVC centers. This reduces that time of teaching and reteaching completely! You are now able to swap the skill and keep on trucking along! You will be able to use these centers as a supplement to your whole-group lesson and/or as an independent center option. The centers all come in two versions: color and ink saving black/white. Each center also comes with a recording sheet! If you choose to utilize these center recording mats for more than one use, then you’ll want to laminate them or place them into a dry-erase sleeve. Students can use a dry-erase marker or plastic manipulative to indicate their answers.BASIC CENTERS!* NO THEMES so you can use them throughout the year.* Color AND Black/White versions included.* Center stays the same-- skills change/build in rigor through the year.

I'm super excited to release these packets for second grade! For the longest time I was completely oblivious that it was not normal to spend every evening and weekend working at school or ""on school"" at home. These packets are designed to give you back your weekends! They have classroom ideas that require minimal preparation and will get you out of a last minute pinch if you should find yourself in one! The activities in these packets will provide additional resources for your whole group writing, math lessons, word work, content and even provide a complete sub lesson plan based on a well known book. What is the Bundle all About? The Teachers Taking Back Their Weekends bundle was inspired from spending countless hours after school and on the weekends in my classroom! Add in a sick day or scheduled doctor’s visit and guarantee yourself up there an additional one to two hours. I wanted to create a packet I could access at any point during the month. I wanted material that was seasonal based, quick to prep, and skill-based for my students at THAT time of the year. If need be, I wanted material that I could leave for my substitute that I could easily run off.What Comes in the Bundle?Each month’s packet follows the same format for added material; writing, word work, math (whole-group and independent), content, a substitute plan, and organization calendars. Each month the packet contains writing material (journal prompts, journal covers, etc). For word work each month you receive two thematic based centers along with recording sheets. You also receive two math centers, recording sheets, and additional independent math practice sheets. Each month’s packet also contains a simple print substitute lesson plans, activities for that month’s content/theme/holiday, and a calendar template for organizing.Be sure to view the preview for additional images!

"FirstieSTEM/KinderSTEM First Grade STEM Curriculum Bundle","$25.00Price $25.00","Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FirstieSTEMKinderSTEM-First-Grade-STEM-Curriculum-Bundle-2644042,"Firstie/KinderSTEM Curriculum Bundle Thanks so much for viewing my Firstie/KinderSTEM Curriculum units bundled. Firstie/KinderSTEM Curriculum is an engaging STEM curriculum with young learners in mind! Firstie/KinderSTEM is standards-based and encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. What is STEM?STEM is the integration (not singular practice) of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math in an active environment that focuses on student-centered learning. Students are engaged in discovering problems, questioning, problem solving, collaborating, and hands on activities while they face real world issues. Students are encouraged to approach the problem based upon their previous learning. Everyone’s voice matters, all ideas matter and are discussed and attempted. Students evaluate their approach and solution throughout the STEM activity and improve their design as they build and experiment. Teachers are facilitators of thinking and guide students through the problem solving experience. What Units Are Included in Firstie/KinderSTEMFirstieSTEM is based upon five units: Motion and Gravity, Rocks and Soil, Changes in Water, Plant/Animal Needs, and States of Matter. Each unit is broken down into five to seven lessons. ** However, please note that each lesson can take several academic days to complete. Each lesson has the standards covered, materials list, lesson vocabulary, STEM design loop integration, detailed activity lesson plans, and all necessary student recording sheets. The units also includes “action” photos, vocabulary cards, parent unit overview letter, parent involvement request slips, STEM design loop, and all other necessary supplies. The lessons will at times suggest the integration of online book sources and online video databases to engage the learners into the unit topic. Please note that all student response sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student STEM journal. You can also choose to have students track their daily STEM activities in their STEM journal with or without the included response sheets.Firstie/KinderSTEM is a Growing Bundle!Unit One: Gravity and Motion INCLUDED Unit Two: Rocks and Soil INCLUDED Unit Three: Changes in Water INCLUDED Unit Four: Plant and Animal Needs INCLUDED Unit Five: States of Matter INCLUDED Overview of Units:Gravity and Motion- During this unit of study, the students will explore motion through understandings of the effects of push, pull, gravity, and force on objects. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create ramps and tracks. Students will be presented with a problem, imagine the possibilities to create a structure, plan the resources they will use, and create a track together in a small group. By the end of this unit, students will understand the STEM design loop and will be able to communicate their understanding of the effects of motion and gravity on an object. Rocks and Soil- During this unit of study, the students will explore rocks and soil through understandings of weathering, erosion, comparing, contrasting, sorting, using their senses to observe and building their understanding of how rocks and soil effect the world around them. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create sifters to help sort rocks and soil. Plant and Animal Needs- In this STEM unit, student will be learning all about the basic needs of plants and animals, will be able to identify plant parts, and will be able to compare and describe various animals. Students will create a habitat for a rainforest animal that will meet their basic needs based on classroom learning. States of Matter- During this unit, the students will identify and experiment with the properties of solids, liquids, and gases. In addition, students will explore the various types of physical changes. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create play dough.Changes in Water- Students will identify and experiment with the water cycle, different stages of water (solid, liquid, gas) and weight of water before and after freezing. The student engineers will use the knowledge they have gained from this unit to create an icehouse. Once the icehouse is made from various materials, each team of engineers will test their icehouses to see if it slows the rate of ice melting compared the uncovered ice cube (constant). This design challenge will allow the students to investigate and demonstrate their understanding of the basic properties of frozen and liquid water What About Standards?The units are based upon commonly phrases state science standards as well as the Next Generation Science Standards! Within the units you'll see those commonly used phrases of science power standards across state to state. Below are additional NGSS!Unit 1: K-PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and interactions, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 2: K-PS3 Energy, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 3: K-ESS2 Earth’s Systems, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 4: K-LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignUnit 5: K-2-ETS1-2. Develop a simple sketch, drawing, or physical model to illustrate how the shape of an object helps it functionas needed to solve a given problem. Why STEM is important?According to the U.S. Department of Education, all STEM jobs in the U.S. will increase 14 percent from 2010-2020, accounting for millions of positions. Yet many will go unfilled, as students are not prepared for an occupation in this field. We can change this, we must change this. Using a STEM approach in teaching allows students to apply learning that occurred in the four subject areas to a real life problem given by the teacher. Students are able to problem solve in a way that the typical classroom learning does not allow. STEM capitalizes on students’ interests and experiences, builds on what they know and have just learned, and provides them an opportunity to take chances and engage in learning in a different way. Using a STEM model prepares students to investigate questions they have about the world they live in and gives them the tools to solve daily problems they encounter. A STEM enriched classroom sounds different as well; students are conversing, sharing ideas, discussing possibilities, and using learned vocabulary as they experiment together. As educators, our job is to teach, create compelling learning environments that foster learning for our students, and prepare them to be college, career, and life ready. The use of vocabulary, hands on approach, and collaboration that occurs during these STEM lessons amazes me as a teacher. Some of my students who struggle with reading or math facts excel in STEM lessons. Their confidence builds as their team listens to their ideas; they feel valued and a part of the learning in a way they never have before. These students find new interests, strengths, and set new goals for their future. I learn more about my students while observing them solve problems in a STEM setting than I do in any other situation in the classroom. * * Be sure to view the preview for a look at the lesson plan set up!What is the difference between KinderSTEM and FirstieSTEM?Kinder and Firstie STEM units are similar in the topics and skills that are covered.

The Numbers Curriculum is designed with preschool and kindergarten teachers in mind. The Numbers Curriculum offers 2 lessons per number for a total of 40 scripted lessons. However, the material can easily be expanded over a longer academic period. The idea of The Numbers Curriculum is you can completely transform your math block teaching with FUN and engaging, yet still rigorous, lessons. The Numbers Curriculum is completely comprehensive, so the only thing you’ll need to add in is a few hands-on items/manipulatives! Here is a quick breakdown of what you get: What is included in The Numbers Curriculum?Detailed lesson plans (2 lessons per number - 40 total)Songs/poems for each letter (1 per number)Number teacher mentor texts (1 per number)Number chant posters (1 per number)Strokes mini booklets (1 per number)Aligned center mats (1 per number)Interactive notebook activities (2 per number)Numbers centers (10 included)Numbers Hands-On Tasks (10 included)Handwriting Tasks (10 included)Handwriting helpersNumber posterNumbers assessment**VIDEO LINKS** (View these detailed videos for a better understanding of the program!)** Overview video: HERE** Actions Demo video: HEREWhat centers are included in The Numbers Curriculum?Center #1: Discrimination CardsCenter #2: Linking CardsCenter #3: Cover-It BoardsCenter #4: Read, Build, Write MatsCenter #5: Puzzlin' MatsCenter #6: Number OrderCenter #7: Tracing CardsCenter #8: Match-UpsCenter #9: Sort MatsCenter #10: Roll and CoverWhat hands-on tasks/tubs are included in The Numbers Curriculum?

The Numbers Curriculum takes away that monotonous way of teaching numbers which students sit and listen to the teacher TEACH. Instead, the Numbers Curriculum encourages guidance from the teacher while the students EXPLORE and LEARN numbers through hands-on and engaging activities that utilize all modes of learning.The Numbers Curriculum is made up of 40 instructional days but can be adjusted to fit your classroom needs. The curriculum includes lessons, songs, centers, exploration tubs, and an assessment piece as a way to ensure student growth.These are just a few highlights you’ll see using the Numbers Curriculum:** Kids...TALKING about numbers** Manipulatives and hands-on material** Fun and engaging learning experiences** Multisensory learning approachQuestions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

Tell me more! What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms) >>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose. >>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details. >>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of KinderLiteracy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The KinderLiteracy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with KinderLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. KinderLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of KinderLiteracy, the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a KinderLiteracy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In KinderLiteracy, these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions.  Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of KinderLiteracy involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Phonemic Awareness instruction for Kindergarten and First Grade Lessons: Why is that important? “Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the K and 1st lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Would you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate unit and bundle covers for these units. One version says 'FirstieSocialStudies' and one says 'Social Studies'.Be sure to view the preview for lots of pictures!Are you interested in my additional content studies curriculum programs?I also have content curriculum programs for science, STEM and health!

Save by purchasing the bundle HERE!Thanks so much for viewing my Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum unit. Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum is an engaging STEM curriculum with young learners in mind! Kinder/FirstieSTEM is standards-based and encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. What is STEM?STEM is the integration (not singular practice) of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math in an active environment that focuses on student-centered learning. Students are engaged in discovering problems, questioning, problem solving, collaborating, and hands on activities while they face real world issues. Students are encouraged to approach the problem based upon their previous learning. Everyone’s voice matters, all ideas matter and are discussed and attempted. Students evaluate their approach and solution throughout the STEM activity and improve their design as they build and experiment. Teachers are facilitators of thinking and guide students through the problem solving experience. An Overview of the Kinder/FirstieSTEM unit!Each unit is broken down into five to seven lessons. ** However, please note that each lesson can take several academic days to complete. Each lesson has the standards covered, materials list, lesson vocabulary, STEM design loop integration, detailed activity lesson plans, and all necessary student recording sheets. The units also includes vocabulary cards, parent unit overview letter, parent involvement request slips, STEM design loop, and all other necessary supplies. The lessons will at times suggest the integration of online book sources and online video databases to engage the learners into the unit topic. Please note that all student response sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student STEM journal. You can also choose to have students track their daily STEM activities in their STEM journal with or without the included response sheets.Plant and Animal Needs- In this STEM unit, student will be learning all about the basic needs of plants and animals, will be able to identify plant parts, and will be able to compare and describe various animals. Students will create a habitat for a rainforest animal that will meet their basic needs based on classroom learning. What About Standards?The units are based upon commonly phrases state science standards as well as the Next Generation Science Standards! Within the units you'll see those commonly used phrases of science power standards across state to state. Below are additional NGSS!Unit 4: K-LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes, K-2-ETS1 Engineering DesignAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, all STEM jobs in the U.S. will increase 14 percent from 2010-2020, accounting for millions of positions. Yet many will go unfilled, as students are not prepared for an occupation in this field. We can change this, we must change this. Using a STEM approach in teaching allows students to apply learning that occurred in the four subject areas to a real life problem given by the teacher. Students are able to problem solve in a way that the typical classroom learning does not allow. STEM capitalizes on students’ interests and experiences, builds on what they know and have just learned, and provides them an opportunity to take chances and engage in learning in a different way. Using a STEM model prepares students to investigate questions they have about the world they live in and gives them the tools to solve daily problems they encounter. A STEM enriched classroom sounds different as well; students are conversing, sharing ideas, discussing possibilities, and using learned vocabulary as they experiment together. As educators, our job is to teach, create compelling learning environments that foster learning for our students, and prepare them to be college, career, and life ready. The use of vocabulary, hands on approach, and collaboration that occurs during these STEM lessons amazes me as a teacher. Some of my students who struggle with reading or math facts excel in STEM lessons. Their confidence builds as their team listens to their ideas; they feel valued and a part of the learning in a way they never have before. These students find new interests, strengths, and set new goals for their future. I learn more about my students while observing them solve problems in a STEM setting then I do in any other situation in the classroom. * * Be sure to view the preview for a look at the lesson plan set up!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"KinderGrossMotor Kindergarten Gross Motor Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderGrossMotor-Kindergarten-Gross-Motor-Curriculum-3306919,"KinderGrossMotor: A gross motor curriculum for primary-aged students! What is KinderGrossMotor?KinderGrossMotor Curriculum is an engaging gross motor curriculum with young learners in mind! KinderGrossMotor introduces the students to 30 whole-body gross motor exercises and teaches them in a kid-friendly way for students. The students are able to grow and develop their gross motor skills by engaging in the 30 routines. Each of the routine cards have an included opener that gives the students experience in proper breathing and stretching their muscles.What is the structure of KinderGrossMotor?KinderGrossMotor consists of 30 routine cards that can be used freely throughout your classroom day. You can choose to use the cards when they best fit your busy schedules. The cards are broken down into five important gross motor categories: strength, core, stretching, balance and jumping. You can base your choice of routine off of the students’ activity level for that given day. There will be days that are best for stretching and days that the students need to exert a lot of energy and jumping might be the best choice. The routines can be used inside the classroom, the hallway or you can take the students outside for the routines.What does the RESEARCH say about KinderGrossMotor?Research shows us that core strengthening for young students is the building block for not only gross motor but several developing skills. The students’ core muscles are those in their abdomen, back and pelvis. Those core muscles are the ‘control center’ for everything the body does. These core muscles give the students the ability to balance and ability to perform coordinated movements on both sides, and they will effect several tasks the child is required to make throughout the school day. The students lacking in any of those areas might struggle with: sitting in their chair, holding a pencil, controlling their scissors and jumping. These lacking skills stem from a majority of outside factors but the leading cause is the decline in physical activity for young students. More and more students are living a sedentary lifestyle through the use of technology devices. By performing gross motor activities in the classrooms, teachers are able to provide a type of engagement that the students might not have experienced at all or little exposure to. The teacher will be engaging their muscles to work, like they're meant to! The tasks in KinderGrossMotor will help the student make gains in their balance, coordinated movements, locomotion skills, eye and foot coordination and best of all – an increase in focus and concentration!*Please note that the routines may be used in any order you choose!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/Sped?You will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate covers. Is KinderGrossMotor a lot of prep?This unit is a quick and simple prep! You will need to decide first if you choose to place all of the lessons on a book ring or print them as one page and place into a binder. Your next decision will be to print out the kindergarten specific covers or the generic grade covers. Print out your covers and then print out the routine cards. Each page will have two routines. Once the lesson cards are printed out, you will then trim around the edges and cut away the extra white paper. Next, you will need to hole punch each of the lesson cards. Place the cards onto the book ring(s) and you are good to go. Laminating the lesson cards is optional. Printing the lesson cards on cardstock is recommended for durability.Are you interested in my additional content studies curriculum programs?Check out the additional content curriculum programs below!KinderSocialSkillsKinderSocialStudiesKinderScience KinderSTEM KinderHealth A SPECIAL thanks to EduClips for this adorable cover clip!

Save BIG when you purchase the KinderWriting® BUNDLED units. View the B U N D L E here!What is KinderWriting®?KinderWriting® Curriculum is an engaging, kindergarten, genre-based writing curriculum. KinderWriting® encourages young learners to look inward at their endless possibilities as a writer. KinderWriting® is based upon nine units: Writing With Pictures, Writing With Sentences, Writing With Stories, Writing With Narrative, Writing With Opinion, Writing With Direction, Writing With Persuasion, Writing With Imagination, and Writing With Information. Each unit is broken down to 20 lessons. The units cover 20 days of academic instruction. The lesson plans have listed unit objectives, “I can” statements, Common Core writing standards and needed mentor texts. KinderWriting encourages a daily routine of a minilesson, independent writing, and a share time. Each of the lessons in KinderWriting are well thought out for the young writer and spiral back to previous lessons to ensure students are retaining their skills. KinderWriting also includes unit anchor charts, a variety of writing paper, conferring schedules and note sheets, sample writings, student writing goals display, writing rubrics, and step-by-step guides that are made specifically for each unit. What is included in KinderWritring Curriculum?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans.-Each unit I have planned out the; big idea, focus standard, essential questions, and so much more! -Writing paper-Unit posters-Student material-Unit rubrics-Spanish posters included!

Each unit has a focus standard that is based upon the Common Core Standards. Units further into the year will have more than one focus standard. If you teach to a varying set of standards, you can email me for assistance. Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonological awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonological awareness instruction in the kindergarten and first grade classrooms is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"FirstieStart Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FirstieStart-Curriculum-2651839,"FirstieStart CurriculumHave you found yourself that first month of first grade completely FRAZZLED!? You know your students need the basics {rhyming, single sounds, syllables, alphabet work, character education}, but you are spending hours hunting down engaging activities to teach the skills? FirstieStart has you covered and the best secret, it's absolutely NO PREP! The first grade version requires no laminating and no cutting! Win!FirstieStart is a very versatile 4 week first grade starter curriculum created by a teacher for teachers! The program is designed to give first grade students a 4 week introduction to skills in the areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, oral listening, and character traits. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. FirstieStart is broken down into four major areas: phonemic awareness, phonics, oral listening/storytelling, and character education. For the oral listening/storytelling the teacher will read an included daily script about the adventures of Sam and Sophia, twins that are starting first grade. The students will have an opportunity to listen as Sam and Sophia go on their daily adventures. Included in the lesson plans as well are daily follow-up questions. The students will respond to the story they had just heard. In the area of phonemic awareness the students will be introduced to the skills: rhyming {identifying and generating}, segmenting, blending, sound identification, and manipulating of sounds. The teacher will lead the students in a variety of activities each week to help build mastery in the skill. The lesson plans provide explicit instruction on what games to play and best of all the games all require NO PREP. The students will also have a phonics piece each week. They will work on a quick review of the entire alphabet included letter formation, letter sound, and daily quick practice sheet.Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. However, a sample whole-group FirstieStart lesson could look like this; students meet at the carpet, students listen to the Sam and Sophia read aloud story, teacher reads read aloud questions and students respond, teacher introduces phonemic awareness skill, students participate in a game/activity that matches the phonemic awareness skill, teacher introduces letter focus, students do a quick letter follow-up practice sheet. You have so many great programs...how/when will YOU use this program?This program is best used the first 4 weeks of school! You can use this during your intervention block or fill your entire small group/setting routines block.What is included in FirstieStart?FirstieStart is designed for a 4 week curriculum and contains 20 days of lesson plans. FirstieStart is not a full academic year of instruction because it is implied that FirstieStart would be solely used those first four weeks of school. FirstieStart would be paired wonderfully with Firstievention. Students would complete the FirstieStart program and then move onto Firstievention.Skills Covered in FirstieStartWeek 1: Rhyming, Bravery, and Letters Aa-EeWeek 2: Rhyming, Respect, and Letters Ff-LlWeek 3: Segmenting, Responsibility, and Letters Mm-RrWeek 4: Sound Manipulation, Perseverance, and Letters Ss-ZzPlease view the preview to see the sample lesson plans/materials!*A neal font version of all the practice sheets is also included!If you are a kindergarten teacher you can check out my KinderStart!If you have any questions at all about this packet please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comVisit my blog Little Minds at Work Follow me on Facebook"

"Intervention Curriculum BUNDLED","$42.00Price $42.00","Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Intervention-Curriculum-BUNDLED-2916503,"Intervention Curriculum BUNDLED (KinderWordBuilding®, Firstievention®, and 2nd Grade Intervention)KinderWordBuilding®, Firstievention®, and 2nd Grade Intervention are very versatile intervention curriculum programs created by a teacher for teachers! The programs are versatile for implementation and varying student levels. You can find success in using this program in your intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, whole-group phonics, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The programs are based upon a slotted thirty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. Each program is broken down into four major areas; word building, word writing, reading fluency, and sight fluency. For word building all students participating in the program will need access to magnetic letters. You can find those online and in teacher resources stores. Students will also need a magnetic surface like a whiteboard or magnetic cookie sheet. For word and sentence writing students will need their own writing journal which has been included within the unit. Reading fluency will be accomplished through the included interactive whiteboard sentence files and/or through the blackline sentences. Lastly, sight fluency will be conducted during transitional periods of your lesson using the included fluency cards.Keep in mind that all lessons can be adjusted to fit your needs. However, a sample whole-group lesson could look like this; students meet at the carpet, students retrieve their letter boards, teacher gives students the first word to build, students build word, students verify their words by viewing the teachers interactive letter board {included in the unit}, students clear their board, students build and check remaining words, students place their boards away and retrieve their journals, teacher prompts students to write each word into their journal, students do so then verify the accuracy of the word by using the teacher’s interactive journal, students write and check sentence, students place journals away and sit at carpet, students read interactive fluency sentences, students read fluency cards, teacher wraps up lesson.If using this program as a whole-group intervention you can look into splitting up your grade level students into different groups based upon their current level. All students should progress through the program from start to finish without skipping any levels. This will guarantee that students are confident in the skill. All students will take assessments to progress to the next level. If students are not ready to progress then the teacher can use the editable plans to add additional words for that skill. If the students are succeeding at an abnormal rate then the teacher can speed up the lesson. However, it should be noted that the highest success comes from using the program with fidelity and not skipping any steps unless necessary for time constraints.What is included in each curriculum program?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans for 100 instructional days. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans. -Fluency cards-Fluency sentences, fluency skill builder sheets, and interactive slides-Interactive magnetic alphabet for teacher use*Students will need access to their own set of magnetic lettersWhat skills are covered in each intervention program? Each curriculum program is designed for a 115 day curriculum. There are 100 days of lessons and 15 additional days for assessment. * *Please note that this unit is complete with all necessary material.

What are the BASIC centers?Have you ever thought, “I wish I had a set of centers that did not need to take precious class time to teach and reteach again. If only there was a set of basic centers that maintained the same systematic routine and just swapped skills!” Well, wait and fret no more! Basic Literacy and Math Centers are just that! This bundle offers 5 systematic centers: write the room, sort by skill, spin and record, match-ups and game boards! Within each of these 5 systematic centers comes 30 included activities. These activities cover the same set of skills throughout. For example, if your students are working on shapes you can choose activities from the write the room, sort by skill, spin and record, match-ups and game boards packets and have a full set of centers for your students. Let’s say your kids are then ready for addition! You will simply pull the addition version of each and your students will not need to be taught how to play the center because they just learned the concept during the shape centers. This reduces that time of teaching and reteaching completely! You are now able to swap the skill and keep on trucking along! You will be able to use these centers as a supplement to your whole-group lesson and/or as an independent center option. The centers all come in two versions: color and ink saving black/white. Each center also comes with a recording sheet! If you choose to utilize these center recording mats for more than one use, then you’ll want to laminate them or place them into a dry-erase sleeve. Students can use a dry-erase marker or plastic manipulative to indicate their answers.BASIC CENTERS!* NO THEMES so you can use them throughout the year.* Color AND Black/White versions included.* Center stays the same-- skills change/build in rigor through the year. How many centers are included? - 30+ centers per packet = 150+ centers (Literacy Centers)- 30+ centers per packet = 150+ centers (Math Centers) That is a total of 300+ centers in this bundle!What

"FirstieMath®: First Grade Math Think and Talk",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FirstieMath-First-Grade-Math-Think-and-Talk-3509553,"What is FirstieMath®: Math: Think and Talk?FirstieMath®: Math: Think and Talk is a supplemental curriculum that can be used to boost any current math curriculum in the classroom! The program is designed to give primary students a way to talk about math through the use of images. Students will also have an opportunity to learn math skills in a hands-on and meaningful way. You can find success through using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, or as a resource for non-certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted fifteen minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. FirstieMath: Think and Talk is created by a teacher for teachers. The program has been carefully created and organized to align with every classroom and curriculum. The lessons can be introduced in any order the teacher chooses. That makes this program available to all teachers that have the desire to boost their math instruction.Tell me more about FirstieMath: Think and Talk! FirstieMath: Think and Talk offers six days of instruction per unit. Each day the students will start the day’s lesson by looking at a fiction or realistic image. The teacher will then guide the students through the math lesson and offer students an opportunity to discuss and evaluate the image. Students will then apply their knowledge in a hands-on and meaningful way. Included within each unit are hands-on and concrete ways to apply the skill along with one practice sheet per image. What are Think and Talk Images?The use of realistic images throughout the units allows students to see math as “real life.” They see the images in a natural way and can then apply that same way of thinking to their everyday lives. As we guide students through the Think and Talk lessons, we really want to offer them what the product’s title states: time to think and time to talk. It’s important that when we present one of the images to the students, we truly encourage them to take their time and really study the image. We then want to give students time to turn and talk with their peers. This will give students a way to verbalize what they saw and learn new ways of thinking from their peers. It’s important that the students have an understanding that the images may have more than one answer and that it’s okay. After the initial conversation regarding the image, teachers are encouraged to prompt students for a follow-up discussion. What knowledge did we gain from this image? How might we see this in our everyday lives? We want to encourage students to be aware of math all around them and to truly enjoy talking about math.What is included in FirstieMath: Think and Talk?- 15 lesson plans (6 days each so a total of 90 days of instruction)- 30 think and talk images (1 realistic and 1 fiction per unit)- 2 practice sheets per unit (30 total)- Applied concrete hands-on ideas per image What skills are covered in FirstieMath: Think and Talk?Unit One: Numbers to 10 Unit Two: Addition to 10 0 Unit Three: Subtraction to 10 Unit Four: GeometryUnit Five: Numbers to 20Unit Six: Add and Subtract to 20Unit Seven: Measurable AttributesUnit Eight: GraphingUnit Nine: Numbers to 40Unit Ten: Add and Subtract to 40Unit Eleven: Math StrategiesUnit Twelve:Numbers to 120 Unit Thirteen: Add and Subtract to 100 Unit Fourteen: Time and MoneyUnit Fifteen: Fractions What is FirstieMath?FirstieMath? is a complete and comprehensive math curriculum.

KinderSocialStudies encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. KinderSocialStudies is based upon five units: Then and Now, Celebrations, Leaders, Family and Inventors. Each unit is broken down into 10 lessons and each lesson can take from 1-2 days to complete. The units cover at least two weeks of instruction. Each lesson plan has the listed objective, “I can” statement, vocabulary, detailed activity lesson plans and all necessary student follow-up practice sheets. KinderSocialStudies encourages a daily routine, but please know that as the teacher you can adjust the lessons and make them work best for your daily schedule and time allotment. Within each lesson the students will partake in a quick lesson opener, whole-group skill lesson, and a follow-up task. Please note that all student follow-up practice sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student journal. All of the follow-up sheets are also differentiated so that you can use these units anytime during the school year, and they will be applicable to your writers or nonwriters. You can also choose to have students track their daily activities in their journal with or without the included response sheets.

There are no one set of standards for social studies. This unit has been based upon the compilation of many state standards. Those state standards were cross-checked to verify the most common occurring standards. If the strand appeared in first grade, the first grade standard was met within the unit as well.

This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this!

"Fine Motor Centers BUNDLED","$10.00Price $10.00","Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fine-Motor-Centers-BUNDLED-3489691,"What is the Fine Motor Bundle of Centers?Thanks so much for viewing my Fine Motor Centers. This bundle is designed to offer a fun and engaging way to practice fine motor skills. You will be able to use these fine motor centers as morning work bin idea, early finishers, small group and/or as an independent center option. The Fine Motor Bundle includes five packets: Find and Flash, Find and Punch, Find and Push, Find and Transfer and Find and Tweeze. The centers will require basic classroom supplies: hole punchers, push-pins, pom-poms and tweezers. The students will need mini squeeze flashlights for the Find and Flash packet. There are color version or black/white versions included for the centers. You also have the option to print the black and white centers on color paper. Before adding these centers into your classroom, you will want to extensively teach how to play the centers correctly. Below you can view the research on using these centers to build fine motor skills.What does the research say about Find and Flash?Over the last several years teacher have begun to notice a difference in their students as they come to school for the first time. And you know what? They are right! Children in larger numbers than ever before in recent history are coming to school and they do not have the foundational skills they need to be successful! Fine motor skills are one of the areas that are lacking. Teachers notice this most in the classroom in how their students are holding their pencils and their ability to form letters. To demonstrate how behind children are below is a list of how children grasp things and what that pattern emerges. Fisted pattern-developed by 12 monthsPronated grasp pattern 2 to 3 yearsStatic Tripod by 3 ½ to 4 yearsDynamic Tripod by 5 yearsOften times kindergarten teachers will notice that many of their students come in holding their writing utensils in a fisted pattern. This is a sign of the student being behind where they should be for their age developmentally. So, essentially we are asking them to run before they can walk if we require them to use a pencil before they know how to grasp it! Students working with the Find and Flash packet and Find and Punch packet help to work on hand strength.Included centers help to separate the sides of the hand and in-hand manipulation. Why is this important? Like every other part of your body you have to be able to stabilize something in order to move something. For example, kids have to be able to stabilize their trunk before they can move their arms. The same is true for the hand. Students need to be able to stabilize one side of their hand (where their pinkie and ring finger are) in order to move the other side of their hand (index, middle finger and thumb). Students need to have dynamic movement when they write. When working with the Find and Tweeze, Find and Transfer & Find and Push students will work on separating the sides of their hands. What packets are included?This set includes FIVE center packets with 5 centers in each! See the skills covered below!Packet One: Find and Flash Set One: Alphabet (Letters A-Z)Set Two: Beginning Sounds Version (Letters A-Z)Set Three: Colors VersionSet Four: Shapes Version (2D Shapes)Set Five Numbers Version (Numbers 1-20)Packet Two: Find and Push Set One: Alphabet (Letters A-Z)Set Two: Beginning Sounds Version (Letters A-Z)Set Three: CVC Words VersionSet Four: Shapes Version (2D Shapes)Set Five Numbers Version (Numbers 1-20)Packet Three: Find and Punch Set One: Alphabet (Letters A-Z)Set Two: Beginning Sounds Version (Letters A-Z)Set Three: Colors Version (11 colors)Set Four: Shapes Version (2D Shapes)Set Five Numbers Version (Numbers 1-10)Packet Four: Find and Tweeze Set One: Alphabet (Letters A-Z)Set Two: Beginning Sounds Version (Letters A-Z)Set Three: CVC WordsSet Four: Sight WordsSet Five Letters (Capital and Lowercase)Set Six: Shapes (2D Shapes)Set Seven: Numbers (1-10)Set Eight: Colors Set Nine: Counting (Numbers 1-20)Set Ten: Counting (Numbers 1-20)Packet Five: Find and Transfer Set One: Alphabet (Letters A-Z)Set Two: Beginning Sounds Version (Letters A-Z)Set Three: Generic Transfer Mats (10 Mats Included)Set Four: Numbers Version (Numbers 1-10)Set Five Shapes Version (2D Shapes)Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"KinderVocabulary: a vocabulary curriculum for primary learners",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderVocabulary-a-vocabulary-curriculum-for-primary-learners-3962294,"KinderVocabulary: a vocabulary curriculum for primary learnersDo you have a few extra moments? Watch DETAILED videos about this program HERE and HERE What is KinderVocabulary?KinderVocabulary Curriculum is an engaging vocabulary curriculum with young learners in mind! KinderVocabulary introduces and expands 250 vocabulary words throughout 50 weeks of lessons. The students are able to grow and develop their vocabularies with the use of KinderVocabulary’s systematic approach. Each week the students will be introduced to a new set of words and have an opportunity to apply their learning in a variety of hands-on, engaging activities. What is the structure of KinderVocabulary?It is important to know that KinderVocabulary is very versatile in that it can be implemented in three different ways. The way in which you decide to implement the curriculum is completely up to you and has no bearing on the overall success your students will achieve with KinderVocabulary. The first implementation option is pairing KinderVocabulary with my KinderLiteracy Curriculum . KinderLiteracy gives students an opportunity to dig deeper within the context of 50 popular read aloud books. KinderVocabulary utilizes matching vocabulary lists so you can easily implement these activities alongside KinderLiteracy. The second implementation option would be to use KinderVocabulary with the matching paired read aloud texts listed here in the packet. This option works great if you are a teacher that is required to teach a big box curriculum and unable to use KinderLiteracy. You can choose to use the read aloud during your shared reading time or flex time. The students will have the context of the book, and you’ll be able to reflect back on the text and make connections as you utilize the KinderVocabulary curriculum. The third implementation option would be to use KinderVocabulary completely separate of any other curriculum or read aloud texts. These word lists and lessons do not require any type of read aloud in order for connections to be established. You would use the included KinderVocabulary “sets” version in which there is not mention of books in the lessons. Again, which implementation option you choose is completely up to you.What is included in KinderVocabulary?- 50 weeks of activities (see detailed description below)- 250 covered words (see the detailed list below)- 10 components for each week (see the detailed components below)- Word lists- Vocabulary journal labels What components are included in KinderVocabulary?Component 1: A vocabulary illustration sheet is included. The students will be able to illustrate each of the weekly words.Component 2: Vocabulary journal prompts are included for all of the weekly words. You can choose between the journal prompts. The students will glue the journal prompt into their vocabulary journal and illustrate or write a response.Component 3: A vocabulary resource ring included a picture and word card for all of the weekly focus words. You can hole punch the cards and place them onto a metal binder ring. Use this ring as a mobile resource or add it into your writing center so students can apply the words in their writing.Component 4: A vocabulary word of the day poster and word of the day definition cards are included. You can display the word of the day or ""password of the day"" near your classroom door. The cards include the definition so they are great as well to use as a resource when introducing or reviewing the weekly words.Component 5: A mini vocabulary staple booklet is included for each week. The students have the word and definition on the booklet. They will cut out the booklet and illustrate a picture for each word.Component 6: Each week there are 4 vocabulary act it out cards. The teacher will lead the students in engaging the vocabulary words in a fun way.Component 7: Differentiated assessments are included each week. There is an included picture version and word version for advanced learners.Component 8: Each week two of the words are chosen to be the focus words. The students will work on the multiple meanings of these words. Real life picture cards are included for these two focus words (6 total cards each week).Component 9: An anchor chart sort is included for the two multiple meaning focus words. There are 8 total clip art image cards included each week to sort on an anchor chart, etc.Component 10: A cut and paste sort is included for the two focus words. The students will cut, sort and paste the clip art pictures.PLEASE VIEW THE TPT PREVIEW AND VIDEOS HERE and HERE TO GET A FULL VISION OF THE PROGRAM!HOW and WHEN can I use this curriculum in my busy day?It is my true belief that this program can be implemented in as little as 5-10 minutes a day and as much as 15-20 minutes depending on your class schedule? WHEN can you implement the program? Do you have a morning meeting time? You can easily introduce the weekly words here! Do you have a few flex minutes for a simple read aloud? You would only need to utilize the read aloud 1-2 times a week so that you could show students the vocabulary words in context! When students are going into the restroom, have them state the definition or action for the vocabulary words! Do you meet with guided reading groups? Integrating vocabulary instruction into your guided reading groups is very beneficial as well! A lot of the activities could be done independently-- possibly a new vocabulary center in your classroom this year! We know the great impact vocabulary instruction has on our kiddos so squeezing it in anyway possible is key!What does the RESEARCH say about KinderVocabulary?The lexicon of a young child can span from very basic terminology and understanding of the words in their native language to one that is rich, complex, and diverse. The question lies in how do we help our students transition from basic to complex? That answer lies in utilizing a curriculum that incorporates extended vocabulary instruction. This type of instruction provides students with opportunities to experience words beyond what is just printed on the page of a book. Coyne et al. (2009) explain that when students have a deeper understanding of word knowledge, they develop the ability to increase their comprehension of texts. They cite a study by Beck and McKeown that showed kindergarten and first grade students who received rich vocabulary instruction were able to make better interpretations of stories compared to their peers that had not. Extended vocabulary instruction allows students to scaffold preexisting knowledge they may have about words and exhibit their newfound knowledge across multiple contexts.What words are included in KinderVocabulary?**A note about the books you see listed below. These are the books from KinderLiteracy. Please see the detailed explanation above about the ways you can implement this program. The books are NOT necessary to use this program. You would merely teach the words in the sets below! The books are encouraged so you can teach the words in ""context"" but it doesn't change the impact this program can have on your kiddos!** Rainbow Fish by Marcus Pfisterglideshimmershockedadmirewise Huggapotamus by Steve Metzgerdelightwaddlespottedskiddedsigh Apples for Everyone by Jill Esbaumbloomripethuddribblerot A Tree for All Seasons by Robin Benardbarecozybudcollectchilly Transportation in My Neighborhood by Shelly Lyonstrafficcrawlswindislandneighborhood Three Little Pigs by Paul Galdonefortunebundlehuffedblaze The Three Bears by Paul Galdonetrustporridgecooledpeekfrightened The Three Billy Goats by Paul Galdonevalleyfinerushingroaredtrampled Stellaluna by Janell Cannonswoopclutchescapeclambercurious Pumpkin Town by Katie McKydulldelicatemarvelsagdistant Veterans Day by Elaine LandauArmed Forces holidaymilitarypatrioticveteran Scarecrow by Cynthia Rylantdawnmammothchatborrowlapel Look, Listen, Taste by Pamela Nettletoncrackledangersignalspupilprotect Reindeer by Katie MariscoactiveantlersArcticmammalhooves Gingerbread Boy by Paul Galdonesniffthreshingfieldstrutdared The Snowy Day by Jack Ezra Keatspiledpathpretendsankfirm Penguins by Anne Schreiberbarbcoastcolonyequatorwebbedmammal Ron’s Big Mission by Corrine Nadenimportantnervousseriousbudgetucked Polar Bears by Laura MarshArcticcubdenfloatsnatch A Bad Case of Stripes by David Shannonfretointmentcontagiouslawnsob Each Kindness by Jacqueline Woodsonbrilliantraggedthawedrippleannounced Snakes by Melissa Stewartmolthibernatepredatorspreypupilscutes Dinosaurs by Kathleen Zoehfeldextinctfossilmuseumpaleontologist Moon by Melanie Mitchellcratersglowneighborrock Storms by Miriam Goinweathercrystalelectricityfunnel Ponies by Laura Marshbreedherdmaresheltertamewild Welcome to the World of Hares by Diane Swansonpelletsfloppykitactiveburrownibble Frogs by Elizabeth Carneycroakgillshabitatpoison Seed to Plant by Kristin Rattinisoilseedlingpollinationgermination Butterflies by Laura Marshnectarchrysalismigrationinstinctgeneration Tigers by Laura Marshendangeredpreyterritorycamouflagecarnivore Helpers in My Community by Bobbie Kalmancommunityvolunteeremergencyrisk Koala Lou by Mem Foximportantnervousseriousbudgetucked Enemy Pie by Derek Munsonenemyrecipesquintedsurprisedmumbled Dolphins by Melissa Stewartcalfequatormammaloxygenpredatorprey The Little Red Hen by Paul Galdonecozysnoozemendedwheatgrind Night Before Thanksgiving by Natasha Wingnestledpatienceleapfeastslice The Polar Express by Chris Van Allsburgconductorsteamwildernessharnesspeakflicker Jamie O’ Rourke by Tomie dePaolaavoidpratiecreptponderwailplenty Chicken Life Cycle by David Schwartzstrutbroodweakpeckreplace The Mitten by Jan Brettknitjostlecommotiongrumbletalonsinvestigate Hogwash by Karma Wilsonplanfetcheddraggedfilthypondered Bear Snores On by Karma Wilsonlairscuttledivvyclutterfretblustery How I Became a Pirate by David Shannonslathershoregulphammockcrew Spiders by Laura Marshegg sacfangpreyvenom Owls by Laura Marshcamouflagepreytalonswingspanowlet Firefighters Help by Dee Readytankpumpcommunityemergencyvisit Bear’s Loose Tooth by Karma Wilsonnibblesavorfretperchpreyflutter The Story of the White House by Marge KennedyWest WingOval OfficeWhite Housecarpenters Duck for President by Doreen CroninfilthelectionballotrequirementdemandThe book and word lists can also be downloaded in the TPT preview.

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of KinderLiteracy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The KinderLiteracy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with KinderLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. KinderLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of KinderLiteracy, the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a KinderLiteracy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word.Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In KinderLiteracy, these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions.  Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of KinderLiteracy involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure.Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Phonemic Awareness instruction for Kindergarten and First Grade Lessons: Why is that important?“Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the K and 1st lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Would you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this!

I have found these story starters to work absolute wonders in my classroom! I’ve found many different ways to incorporate them as well which I will share on the following page! What I love about the story starters the most is their ability to assist the students when working independently. Students WANT to work without the assistance of their teacher, but sometimes they just don’t know how. This can be especially true in writing. Students of course would love to write a story of their own, but they at times don’t know what to write about. The story starters take that out of the equation. Students simply look at the picture given to them and start to write their story! This resource can be used alongside your whole group writing instruction, during independent student work time {work on writing}, or a supplement to your writing curriculum. On the following page I will explain in detail how to use the story starters.

"KinderHandwriting Kindergarten Handwriting Curriculum Part One",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderHandwriting-Kindergarten-Handwriting-Curriculum-Part-One-3267952,"KinderHandwriting Curriculum Part One: A systematic and comprehensive handwriting curriculum for the primary classroom.SAVE BIG by purchasing the KinderHandwriting B U N D L E!What is KinderHandwriting?KinderHandwriting is a systematic and versatile handwriting curriculum that can be used to supplement any current curriculum in the classroom! The program is designed to give primary students a way to practice and master writing the letters of the alphabet in a hands-on and meaningful way. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non-certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted twenty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. KinderHandwriting is created by a teacher for teachers. The program has been carefully created and organized to align with every classroom and curriculum. The letters can be introduced in any order the teacher chooses. That makes this program available to all teachers that have the desire to boost their handwriting instruction.Tell me more about KinderHandwriting! KinderHandwriting offers two days of instruction per capital and lowercase letter. Each day the students will start the day’s lesson with whole-body movements. The teacher will then introduce the day’s letter utilizing the included interactive path of motion slides. Students will then practice the letter in a hands-on and meaningful way. Included are ten ideas for your hands-on handwriting bins. After the hands-on practice, students will apply their knowledge of the letter by practicing the path of motion with a dry-erase marker and handwriting helper board. The handwriting helper is simply printed and placed into a dry erase sleeve. Lastly, students wrap up the day’s lesson by applying their knowledge of the letter on a paper and pencil follow-up sheet. Why is handwriting instruction so important?Handwriting instruction in the primary classroom is not a new concept but it is one that can easily be pushed aside for the more prominent instruction of ELA and mathematics. However, handwriting is a core skill that every student should master. Handwriting is a complex skill engaging cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills simultaneously. It is best learned through direct instruction (Beringner, 2015; Berninger et al. 2006; Hanstra-Bletz and Blote, 1993; Maeland, 1992). KinderHandwriting recognizes the importance of handwriting instruction along with the complex processes that each letter contains. KinderHandwriting breaks down these complex letters into achievable tasks, acceptable for all learners.What is included in KinderHandwriting?- 52 (2 day) lesson plans *a total of 104 instructional days- 52 interactive letter math of motion files- Handwriting hands-on tubs overview sheets- 6 letter practice sheet per letter (312 total)- Alphabet cards- Handwriting helper writing inserts What skills are covered in KinderHandwriting?Letters A-Z (capitals)Letters a-z (lowercase)Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of KinderLiteracy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The KinderLiteracy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with KinderLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. KinderLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of KinderLiteracy, the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a KinderLiteracy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word.Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In KinderLiteracy, these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions.  Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of KinderLiteracy involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure.Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Phonemic Awareness instruction for Kindergarten and First Grade Lessons: Why is that important?“Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the K and 1st lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Would you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

All too often we read article after article to support the fact that there is an extremely high need in providing students with the life skills they so desperately need to be successful in today’s society. Currently education identifies core curricula as language arts, math, science, and social studies. However, Dr. Spencer Kagan, a world renowned author and keynote speaker in the fields of both education and psychology, points out that life skills are just as important in an educational setting as the other core curricula and should be treated as such. Dr. Kagan (2003) points out that compared to previous generations, students today come to school lacking many basic life skills, including social, emotional, organizational and citizenship skills. Although there are many factors that have contributed to this decline, he points out that once these students grow up, they will need these skills in a work force that is now placing a greater emphasis on teamwork and interdependence. Dr. Kagan’s resolution to this crisis is for students to be exposed to a comprehensive life skills curriculum that will address these deficits.Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"KinderStorytelling: Storytelling and Comprehension Curriculum",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderStorytelling-Storytelling-and-Comprehension-Curriculum-3165061,"What is the KinderStorytelling Curriculum?KinderStorytelling was created by a teacher for teachers! This supplemental comprehension curriculum is made up of 20 stories. KinderStorytelling is a researched-based, explicit, supplemental curriculum program. The teacher has 20 directed teacher lesson plans to follow, and all needed material for the lessons to be a success are included. Furthermore, KinderStorytelling is a systematic curriculum program. This simply means that the students follow the same routine each lesson. Listening comprehension is a skill that is worked on in classrooms throughout the school year. Have you ever read a story to your class and then asked them a question but they were unable to answer it? Were they not listening? Well, maybe they were and they were not able to comprehend what they had heard. This is especially common for ELL students. Storytelling is an excellent way for all students to be introduced and contextualized to new language/vocabulary, connect to feelings and memories, and make visualizations of the story by listening closely to the details.Please note that you can change the order of the stories to fit your needs and seasons. There is also an opportunity for your students to listen to the included audio files of the stories verses listening to you read the stories. Below is a quick description of how each lesson is broken down.**WATCH A VIDEO EXPLAINING THE PROGRAM IN DETAIL HERE! ** How can I use this program? KinderStorytelling can be used as part of your whole-group reading lesson, shared reading lesson, RTI lesson, ELL program, intervention lesson or used for a para or aide to assist in the learning process! What does a KinderStorytelling lesson look like? * Introduce the story and the students’ schema.* Read the story “cold” AKA don’t stop the first read through. After the first read, ask the comprehension questions. You can also choose to ""play"" my virtual version of the story. Just push play the students will listen as I read the story to them.* Reread the story with action. When students add movement to the story, their retention of the story skyrockets. The lesson plans include actions for the students to add to the story. Reread the story with action 2-3 times.* Students work with partners to retell the story. Students will go back and forth with their partners to retell the story, again furthering their understanding of the story.* Connect the story to a reading strategy classroom poster and student practice sheet follow-up.* Comprehension quiz.What is included in KinderStorytelling?-20 scripted lesson plans-20 written stories (printable format)-20 stories (VIRTUAL format) -- use for listening devices-20 student reading strategies practice sheets *two differentiated versions*-20 reading comprehension quizzes-5 reading strategy postersWhat skills/standards are covered? Reading strategies: Retell, Questioning, Predictions, Connections and InferringCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.K.2Confirm understanding of a text read aloud or information presented orally or through other media by asking and answering questions about key details and requesting clarification if something is not understood.CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.1.2Ask and answer questions about key details in a text read aloud or information presented orally or through other media.I already own several of your other programs. How is this different? Do I really need this? That last question is ultimately your decision. However, I can do my part in best explaining how this program can be used and how it differs from my other programs! This program explicitly teaches JUST listening comprehension! I do a lot of explaining in the video linked above. My other programs do cover literacy standards but this packet has listening comprehension as its number one priority! Furthermore, this program offers great benefits and excitement with the virtual story components! Those can be used alongside your independent centers!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

Thanks!Ah, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. When it comes to writing there are two major parts to a writing block. The mini lesson and the independent writing time. In a mini lesson, we are able to meet students at their level and expand through modeling of our own stories. If working with Pre-K students, you might need to expand on your teacher modeling and spend less time on the independent writing. For first grade, you will want to lessen the modeling and increase student independent writing time. At this time I do not have a separate Pre-K writing program planned. I do have plans to release a first grade writing program in the summer of 2018. Please note that NO student materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know!

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of 2nd Grade Literacy Units Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The 2nd Grade Literacy Units close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with FirstieLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. FirstieLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of FirstieLiteracy , the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a 2nd Grade Literacy Units text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In FirstieLiteracy , these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions. Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of 2nd Grade Literacy Units involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Do you teach first grade?

Hi there and thanks so much for viewing my packet, Stretch and Write! It never fails that as a teacher we catch ourselves daily saying something like, ""Stretch it out."" or ""Well, what sounds do you hear?"" We want our students to be independent in stretching out words but we know that this does not come easy to them and something that needs practiced a lot! In this packet the students will have an opportunity to work on stretching out words in an assisted and repetitive motion!The students will state the picture name, stretch the three sounds they hear, write the three sounds they hear and then put those sounds back together as they restate the word!> > A NEW DISTANCE LEARNING GOOGLE READY VERSION IS NOW INCLUDED! PLEASE VIEW *THIS* PREVIEW TO VIEW THE GOOGLE SLIDES VERSION! < <How is Stretch and Write Differentiated? Assisted Write: Students will state the picture name, stretch the sounds, write the sounds (using the assisted sound given) and then restate the word that was stretched. This version is best used for students that are yet to be comfortable with hearing ALL of the sounds in a word. The “given sound” can vary between the beginning, medial and ending.Stretch and Write: Students will complete the sheet as stated above. However, this time the students will not have the assisted sound given to them. By having the word at the end of the task, students are able to restate the word without error. This helps those struggling with auditory processing. Those students will often stretch each sound but then state the wrong word, cat, /c/, /a/, /t/, “cap”.Independent Write: For this version the students will not have the given sound boxes and will write the words independently. This is especially important if you are wanting the students to write ALL sounds, even those sounds that are not “heard” like in the words apple or cake. How can I use this packet in MY classroom? These sheets can be used in multiple ways but here are a few ideas! Do you have an independent writing center or writing folders? These sheets would be great for that area! How about a word work center or word work baskets? You can laminate the sheets for repeated use, place on a metal ring or leave them loose leaf!You can also use these sheets at your guided reading table or intervention group! Place them into a binder inside sheet protectors and you have ""go to"" center or RTI activity! I would love to see this packet in ACTION! Of course! Check out THIS video! What is included in this packet? - 75 stretch and write sheets (offered in 3 differentiated levels)Skills covered: CVC words, word families, alphabet, double ending, CVCe, digraphs, blends, vowel teams, and diphthongs.Word Families Included: an, ap, ad, ag, am, at, ed, en, et, in, ip, op, ot, un, ug, all, amp, and, eck, ell, ick, ill, ock and uck.Have additional questions?

"Kinder/FirstieSTEM Kindergarten STEM Curriculum Unit One: Gravity and Motion",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderFirstieSTEM-Kindergarten-STEM-Curriculum-Unit-One-Gravity-and-Motion-3318415,"Kinder/FirstieSTEM Unit One: Gravity and Motion This packet is part of my Kinder/FirstieSTEM bundle. Save by purchasing the bundle HERE!Thanks so much for viewing my Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum unit. Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum is an engaging STEM curriculum with young learners in mind! Kinder/FirstieSTEM is standards-based and encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. What is STEM?STEM is the integration (not singular practice) of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math in an active environment that focuses on student-centered learning. Students are engaged in discovering problems, questioning, problem solving, collaborating, and hands on activities while they face real world issues. Students are encouraged to approach the problem based upon their previous learning. Everyone’s voice matters, all ideas matter and are discussed and attempted. Students evaluate their approach and solution throughout the STEM activity and improve their design as they build and experiment. Teachers are facilitators of thinking and guide students through the problem solving experience. An Overview of the Kinder/FirstieSTEM unit!Each unit is broken down into five to seven lessons. ** However, please note that each lesson can take several academic days to complete. Each lesson has the standards covered, materials list, lesson vocabulary, STEM design loop integration, detailed activity lesson plans, and all necessary student recording sheets. The units also includes vocabulary cards, parent unit overview letter, parent involvement request slips, STEM design loop, and all other necessary supplies. The lessons will at times suggest the integration of online book sources and online video databases to engage the learners into the unit topic. Please note that all student response sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student STEM journal. You can also choose to have students track their daily STEM activities in their STEM journal with or without the included response sheets.Gravity and Motion- During this unit of study, the students will explore motion through understandings of the effects of push, pull, gravity, and force on objects. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create ramps and tracks. Students will be presented with a problem, imagine the possibilities to create a structure, plan the resources they will use, and create a track together in a small group. By the end of this unit, students will understand the STEM design loop and will be able to communicate their understanding of the effects of motion and gravity on an object. What About Standards?The units are based upon commonly phrases state science standards as well as the Next Generation Science Standards! Within the units you'll see those commonly used phrases of science power standards across state to state. Below are additional NGSS!Unit 1: K-PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and interactions, K-2-ETS1 Engineering Design Why STEM is important?According to the U.S. Department of Education, all STEM jobs in the U.S. will increase 14 percent from 2010-2020, accounting for millions of positions. Yet many will go unfilled, as students are not prepared for an occupation in this field. We can change this, we must change this. Using a STEM approach in teaching allows students to apply learning that occurred in the four subject areas to a real life problem given by the teacher. Students are able to problem solve in a way that the typical classroom learning does not allow. STEM capitalizes on students’ interests and experiences, builds on what they know and have just learned, and provides them an opportunity to take chances and engage in learning in a different way. Using a STEM model prepares students to investigate questions they have about the world they live in and gives them the tools to solve daily problems they encounter. A STEM enriched classroom sounds different as well; students are conversing, sharing ideas, discussing possibilities, and using learned vocabulary as they experiment together. As educators, our job is to teach, create compelling learning environments that foster learning for our students, and prepare them to be college, career, and life ready. The use of vocabulary, hands on approach, and collaboration that occurs during these STEM lessons amazes me as a teacher. Some of my students who struggle with reading or math facts excel in STEM lessons. Their confidence builds as their team listens to their ideas; they feel valued and a part of the learning in a way they never have before. These students find new interests, strengths, and set new goals for their future. I learn more about my students while observing them solve problems in a STEM setting then I do in any other situation in the classroom. * * Be sure to view the preview for a look at the lesson plan set up!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

Vertical number paths are like horizontal numbers paths in how they are used. However, a vertical number path simply makes sense to students. Students know that numbers get bigger (more) and smaller (less). A traditional horizontal number path does not support this in a visual way like a vertical number path does. Using a vertical number path, students can see the numbers get bigger and smaller by thinking of the number path as a tower-like visual.

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of 2nd Grade Literacy Units Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The 2nd Grade Literacy Units close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with FirstieLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. FirstieLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of FirstieLiteracy , the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a 2nd Grade Literacy Units text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In FirstieLiteracy , these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions. Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of 2nd Grade Literacy Units involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Do you teach first grade?

"Sortin' Through the Year",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sortin-Through-the-Year-3263119,"Sortin' Through the Year: A systematic and comprehensive supplemental phonics program for the primary classroom.Do you have a few extra moments? LISTEN and WATCH more about Sortin' Through the Year HERE!What is Sortin' Through the Year?Sortin’ Through the Year is a systematic and versatile program that can be used to supplement any current curriculum in the classroom! The program is designed to give primary students a way to practice phonics skills in a hands-on and meaningful way. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted ten to fifteen minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. Tell me more about Sortin' Through the year! Sortin’ Through the Year is created by a teacher for teachers. The program has been carefully created and organized to align with every classroom and curriculum. The skills can be introduced and combined any order the teacher chooses. That makes this program available to all teachers that have the desire to boost their phonics instruction.What are phonics sorts?Phonics sorts offer students an opportunity to practice the particular skill in a hands-on and conceptual way. This allows students to see how letters and words work. Phonics sorts also allow offer an opportunity for students to move past learning the skill in a memorization way, instead they apply their problem solving skills and discover the pattern that lies within each sort. Once students are able to identify the pattern, they will begin to understand the English language which will reflect in their reading and writing abilities. Phonics sorts have been thoroughly researched and tested, they have proven successful time after time. This is displayed in an article posted by the International Literacy Association where a group of teachers researched and “classroom certified” the positive influences of phonics sorts. “We have found word study to be a teacher-directed yet student-centered approach to spelling instruction, and when integrated into a comprehensive literacy program it can help support young children’s literacy development.” Williams et al. (2009)How can I differentiate the phonics sorts? There are a few different options when it comes to using the sorts beyond a traditional closed sort. First, you may choose to give the students a set of picture or word cards and no header cards. Be giving the students no header card, they will have to determine the sort category independently. This is called an open sort. Another option is call out the words without showing the picture or word card. Students will merely point to the category header that the card belongs to. This type of sort is called a blind sort. Lastly, you might choose to bump up the fluency of the sort and do a speed sort. You will set a timer or play a game to see who can sort the quickest. You can extend these sorts even further by introducing the students to a writing sort. The students write the words into their notebooks instead of pasting the pictures. You can then also have them write the complete sentences using the words or create their own sentences as well.What is included in Sortin' Through the Year?- 160 lesson plans- Alphabet cards- 960 picture cards (color and b/w)- 960 word cards- 160 sets of Sort header cards- 160 interactive notebook sort sheets- 160 interactive notebook sentence sheetsWhat does a sample 2-day lesson plan look like for Sortin' Through the Year?Alphabet (Day One):Step One: Alphabet letter names and sounds review.Step Two: Alphabet beginning sound picture cards.Step Three: Teacher-led beginning sound sort.Step Four: Independent sort into interactive notebooks.Alphabet (Day Two):Step One: Alphabet letter names and sounds review.Step Two: Alphabet beginning sound picture cards.Step Three: Teacher-led picture to word match.Step Four: Partner sort under headers and interactive notebook follow-up.Beyond Alphabet (Day One):Step One: Teacher-led skill review sort.Step Two: Introduction of skill picture cards.Step Three: Teacher-led skill sound sort.Step Four: Independent sort into interactive notebooks.Beyond Alphabet (Day Two):Step One: Teacher-led skill review sort.Step Two: Introduction of skill picture cards.Step Three: Teacher-led picture to word match.Step Four: Partner sort under headers and interactive notebook follow-up.

PrimaryClassMeetings,N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/PrimaryClassMeetings-3350178,"PrimaryClassMeetings: A set of 20 class meeting lessons to guide students in being thoughtful and kind classroom citizens. What is PrimaryClassMeetings?PrimaryClassMeetings Curriculum is an engaging and supplemental curriculum with young learners in mind! PrimaryClassMeetings takes 20 common class-building skills and teaches them in a kid-friendly way for students. The students are able to grow and develop by listening to a definition of the skill and acting on the skill in a hands-on way. PrimaryClassMeetings Curriculum consists of 20 two-day lesson plans. Day one is an introduction of the skill and verbal practice. Day two is a review of the skill and a hands-on approach to applying the skill. On the second day the students are also asked to deeply think and apply the skill to their own lives. On both days the students will interact with their peers through verbal discussions. The teacher will lead the initial conversation and then turn it over to the students for their opportunity to have collaborative peer discussion. PrimaryClassMeetings Curriculum can be taught in a once a week fashion or every other week. You can teach the lessons as part of your morning meeting or a separate class-building time of the day.What lessons are included in PrimaryClassMeetings?Lesson 1: Getting to Know YouLesson 2: FriendshipLesson 3: We Are a Classroom CommunityLesson 4: Working TogetherLesson 5: CharacterLesson 6: Following DirectionsLesson 7: Making MistakesLesson 8: ComplimentsLesson 9: TeamworkLesson 10: Following RulesLesson 11: CommunicatingLesson 12: Being FlexibleLesson 13: Positive Self-TalkLesson 14: HonestyLesson 15: GratitudeLesson 16: PatienceLesson 17: Shout-OutsLesson 18: EmpathyLesson 19: Problem-solvingLesson 20: Acts of KindnessIs PrimaryClassMeetings a lot of prep?This unit is a quick and simple prep! You will need to decide first if you choose to place all of the lessons on a book ring or print them as one page and place into a binder. Print out your cover and then print out the routine cards. Each page will have two routines. Once the lesson cards are printed out, you will then trim around the edges and cut away the extra white paper. Next, you will need to hole punch each of the lesson cards. Place the cards onto the book ring(s) and you are good to go. Laminating the lesson cards is optional. Printing the lesson cards on cardstock is recommended for durability.Are you interested in my additional content studies curriculum programs?Check out the additional content curriculum programs below!KinderSocialSkillsKinderSocialStudiesKinderScience KinderSTEM KinderHealth A SPECIAL thanks to EduClips for this adorable cover clip!

"Kinder/FirstieSTEM Kindergarten STEM Unit Two: Rocks and Soil",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderFirstieSTEM-Kindergarten-STEM-Unit-Two-Rocks-and-Soil-3318418,"Kinder/FirstieSTEM Unit Two: Rocks and Soil This packet is part of my Kinder/FirstieSTEM bundle. Save by purchasing the bundle HERE!Thanks so much for viewing my Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum unit. Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum is an engaging STEM curriculum with young learners in mind! Kinder/FirstieSTEM is standards-based and encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. What is STEM?STEM is the integration (not singular practice) of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math in an active environment that focuses on student-centered learning. Students are engaged in discovering problems, questioning, problem solving, collaborating, and hands on activities while they face real world issues. Students are encouraged to approach the problem based upon their previous learning. Everyone’s voice matters, all ideas matter and are discussed and attempted. Students evaluate their approach and solution throughout the STEM activity and improve their design as they build and experiment. Teachers are facilitators of thinking and guide students through the problem solving experience. An Overview of the Kinder/FirstieSTEM unit!Each unit is broken down into five to seven lessons. ** However, please note that each lesson can take several academic days to complete. Each lesson has the standards covered, materials list, lesson vocabulary, STEM design loop integration, detailed activity lesson plans, and all necessary student recording sheets. The units also includes vocabulary cards, parent unit overview letter, parent involvement request slips, STEM design loop, and all other necessary supplies. The lessons will at times suggest the integration of online book sources and online video databases to engage the learners into the unit topic. Please note that all student response sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student STEM journal. You can also choose to have students track their daily STEM activities in their STEM journal with or without the included response sheets.Rocks and Soil- During this unit of study, the students will explore rocks and soil through understandings of weathering, erosion, comparing, contrasting, sorting, using their senses to observe and building their understanding of how rocks and soil effect the world around them. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create sifters to help sort rocks and soil. What About Standards?The units are based upon commonly phrases state science standards as well as the Next Generation Science Standards! Within the units you'll see those commonly used phrases of science power standards across state to state. Below are additional NGSS!Unit 2: K-PS3 Energy, K-2-ETS1 Engineering Design Why STEM is important?According to the U.S. Department of Education, all STEM jobs in the U.S. will increase 14 percent from 2010-2020, accounting for millions of positions. Yet many will go unfilled, as students are not prepared for an occupation in this field. We can change this, we must change this. Using a STEM approach in teaching allows students to apply learning that occurred in the four subject areas to a real life problem given by the teacher. Students are able to problem solve in a way that the typical classroom learning does not allow. STEM capitalizes on students’ interests and experiences, builds on what they know and have just learned, and provides them an opportunity to take chances and engage in learning in a different way. Using a STEM model prepares students to investigate questions they have about the world they live in and gives them the tools to solve daily problems they encounter. A STEM enriched classroom sounds different as well; students are conversing, sharing ideas, discussing possibilities, and using learned vocabulary as they experiment together. As educators, our job is to teach, create compelling learning environments that foster learning for our students, and prepare them to be college, career, and life ready. The use of vocabulary, hands on approach, and collaboration that occurs during these STEM lessons amazes me as a teacher. Some of my students who struggle with reading or math facts excel in STEM lessons. Their confidence builds as their team listens to their ideas; they feel valued and a part of the learning in a way they never have before. These students find new interests, strengths, and set new goals for their future. I learn more about my students while observing them solve problems in a STEM setting then I do in any other situation in the classroom. * * Be sure to view the preview for a look at the lesson plan set up!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

There are no one set of standards for social studies. This unit has been based upon the compilation of many state standards. Those state standards were cross-checked to verify the most common occurring standards. If the strand appeared in first grade, the first grade standard was met within the unit as well. If you have specific standards questions please reference the detailed lesson overview list above and/or email littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comAh, I love this but I teach PreK/First/SpedYou will notice that this packet is marked as Pre-K, Kindergarten and First Grade! This is not something I do often or lightly! I find it very frustrating to purchase a packet and it not be grade level appropriate. I have included two differentiated versions to all practice sheets. These two versions work for non-writers (coloring) and writers (writing 3-4 simple sentences). Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate unit and bundle covers for these units. One version says 'FirstieSocialStudies' and one says 'Social Studies'.Be sure to view the preview for lots of pictures!Are you interested in my additional content studies curriculum programs?I also have content curriculum programs for science, STEM and health!

What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of KinderLiteracy Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The KinderLiteracy close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with KinderLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. KinderLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of KinderLiteracy, the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a KinderLiteracy text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word.Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In KinderLiteracy, these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions.  Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of KinderLiteracy involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure.Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Phonemic Awareness instruction for Kindergarten and First Grade Lessons: Why is that important?“Phonemic awareness and letter knowledge have been identified in several research studies (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkerson, 1985; Adams, 1990; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) as the two key indicators of how well children will master beginning reading skills during the first two years in school. Because it plays such a vital role in forming the foundation of reading development, phonemic awareness is the first thread in the tapestry of reading” (Threads of Reading, Karen Tankersley). The addition of daily phonemic awareness instruction in the K and 1st lessons is vital to tying together decoding and comprehension as a young reader.Would you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"KinderNumberWriting: Numbers 0-20",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderNumberWriting-Numbers-0-20-4138087,"What is KinderNumberWriting?KinderNumberWriting is a systematic and versatile handwriting curriculum that can be used to supplement any current curriculum in the classroom! The program is designed to give primary students a way to practice and master writing numbers in a hands-on and meaningful way.You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided math groups, or as a resource for non-certified staff members assisting in the classroom.The program is based upon a slotted twenty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. KinderNumberWriting is created by a teacher for teachers. The program has been carefully created and organized to align with every classroom and curriculum.The numbers can be introduced in any order the teacher chooses. That makes this program available to all teachers that have the desire to boost their math instruction.**View a video preview of KinderNumberWriting HERE**Tell me more about KinderNumberWriting! KinderNumberWriting offers two days of instruction per number. Each day the students will start the day’s lesson with whole-body movements. The teacher will then introduce the day’s number utilizing the included interactive path of motion slides. Students will then practice the number in a hands-on and meaningful way. Included are ten ideas for your hands-on number bins. After the hands-on practice, students will apply their knowledge of the number by practicing the path of motion with a dry-erase marker and handwriting helper board. The handwriting helper is simply printed and placed into a dry erase sleeve. Lastly, students wrap up the day’s lesson by applying their knowledge of the number with a paper and pencil follow-up sheet. Why is handwriting instruction so important?Handwriting instruction in the primary classroom is not a new concept but it is one that can easily be pushed aside for the more prominent instruction of ELA and mathematics. However, handwriting is a core skill that every student should master. Handwriting is a complex skill engaging cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills simultaneously.

Please note that NO student materials and NO teacher materials have the ""KINDER"" name on them so you do not have to worry about this! As teachers we are the only ones to ultimately make the decision as to know if it will work for our kids, if I can help with this decision please let me know! Please note that I have included alternate unit and bundle covers for these units. One version says 'FirstieSocialStudies' and one says 'Social Studies'.Be sure to view the preview for lots of pictures!Are you interested in my additional content studies curriculum programs?I also have content curriculum programs for science, STEM and health!

It also fosters social interaction.Math (Pre-K Math): Pre-K Math Curriculum is teacher-created, kid-tested, and kid-approved. Instead of traditional methods, Pre-K Math encourages interactive, hands-on learning with partners, guided by the teacher. Each unit consists of 10 instructional days and includes post-tests to measure student growth. The curriculum also ensures continuous review of previously taught skills, promoting ongoing mastery.

It includes pre and post assessments to track student progress and also focuses on articulation, multisensory learning, and fluency. The unit is based on a sound-focused or sound-first approach.

It includes pre and post assessments to track student. Learning CVC words is crucial for the science of reading as it helps students understand the basic structure of words and the relationship between letters and sounds. This skill is essential for decoding, allowing students to sound out and read new words independently. Additionally, recognizing and spelling CVC words builds a strong foundation for more complex word patterns and contributes to overall reading fluency.Life Skills (KinderLifeSkills): KinderLifeSkills is a comprehensive life skills curriculum designed as an engaging program that covers 75 common life skills. KinderLifeSkills is taught through kid-friendly oral stories featuring Levi the Life Skills Lion, who guides students on adventures to introduce broad life skills concepts.

With this program you will not need to supplement another whole-group reading program. Each week you will focus on one text and each day look closely at that text. 2nd Grade Literacy is a 35 week literacy curriculum. The units have been completely planned out for you, but with the ability for you to have them meet your individual needs. 2nd Grade Literacy is a simple print and teach literacy curriculum. No more tracking down ideas, books, printables, and cumulative activities! I have it covered! What is included in 2nd Grade Literacy?-Teacher ""simple read"" lesson plans. You will not need to rewrite these lesson plans, unless you choose do. If so I have included editable lesson plans.-Each week I have planned out the; big idea, focus standard, essential questions, comprehension focus, story element focus, teaching strategy, vocabulary, and so much more! -Weekly assessments are included (a mix of multiple choice and short answer)Unit Two: The World Around Us From Seed to Plant, Forces Make Things Move, Sounds All Around, Do I Want It or Do I Need It, Bat Loves the NightWhat else will I need for the lessons to be a successful? Can I see more?Please view the preview to see the scope and sequence of 2nd Grade Literacy Units, necessary books and more!Tell me more! What is Close Reading?“Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” (Nancy Boyles, Educational Leadership)“The overarching goal of close reading is to cause students to engage in critical thinking with a text.” (Dr. Douglas Fisher, Close Reading in Elementary Classrooms)>>Close, analytic reading stresses engaging with a complex text directly and examining meaning thoroughly and methodically, encouraging students to read and reread with a purpose.>>By directing students attention to the text itself, we empower students to understand the central ideas and key supporting details.>>This purposeful reading enables students to reflect on the meanings of words and sentences; the order the sentences unfold; and the development of ideas over the course of the text-which ultimately leads to students to understanding the text as a whole.As close reading practices are implemented over time, students become better equipped to handle more difficult texts, both in the classroom and independently.Components of 2nd Grade Literacy Units Close Reading and How it Supports Best Practices:Determine what the text says: Understanding one’s purpose for reading is a metacognitive process that supports a reader’s comprehension of text. The 2nd Grade Literacy Units close reading structure requires students to apply their sense of purposeful reading in order to locate information in a text. In addition with FirstieLiteracy, teachers can think aloud and model how to read with a purpose by clearly stating the different purposes for them. Before and during reading, students discuss with partners and as a whole group their background knowledge, or schema, about the text topic. FirstieLiteracy provides students with opportunities to develop collaborative conversation skills, integrating text evidence into their discussions. This allows students and teachers to determine their level of knowledge about a topic, which in turn will determine how a reader will read the text. Teachers can help students gain a thorough understanding of the text during the first read by posing low level questions in order to check for understanding and allow students to turn and talk. After the first reading, students should have an understanding of their level of knowledge on the text topic and have a general understanding of what the text is about. Throughout the week of FirstieLiteracy , the text (or parts of the text) will be read more than once, each time with a different purpose for reading.Reread the text to focus on unknown words or phrases: The second reading of a 2nd Grade Literacy Units text week usually involves a focus on unknown words or phrases within the text. Students listen tentatively as the teacher reads aloud parts of the text, leading a discussion about any unknown words or phrases. Students can engage with unknown vocabulary in a variety of ways, such as: recording words as they hear them (as opposed to the teacher telling them which words are the vocabulary words), working in partners or small groups to determine the meaning of unknown words based on the text, or using the context clues to determine a “kid friendly” definition of the word/s, as well as an “action” to describe the word. Deepen understanding through Text Dependent Questions: “Text-dependent questions are used in reading instruction to promote the habit of rereading text in order to build schema” (Fisher & Frey, Pearson & Johnson). In FirstieLiteracy , these specific questions cause students to dive deeper into the text and signal to readers the information is complex enough to linger over the details. The text dependent questions move from explicitly stated information (similar to those asked after the first read) to those that require inferential and critical reading. Comprehension deepens at this stage of the lesson, as the basic outline of the text is now understood, allowing students to go back into the text to look for evidence to text dependent questions. Evaluate the quality and value of the text: The fourth day of 2nd Grade Literacy Units involves comparing the text in a variety of ways. The purpose for reading on this day provides students with opportunities to develop conversation skills, while they integrate evidence from the text into their discussions. The collaboration that takes place on this day allows students to make a claim about the text, provide evidence to support the claim, and offer counter claims-all of which are necessary skills to be college and career ready. Comparisons of the text and author’s purpose can also be done through collaborative projects in which students must work together toward a common goal. Hattie’s research tells us that activities that involve cooperative learning, goal setting, and problem solving all have high effects on student learning. All of these components take place in this close reading structure. Strive for meaning through a writing prompt or extended discussion with a focus on synthesizing: The final stage of the close reading model involves a post-reading task to demonstrate understanding of the standards and skills taught throughout the close reading lesson. The main focus of this day is to present students with a task that is not completely based on personal experience, but requires them to have read and deeply understood the text in order to complete the task. Students can demonstrate understanding through a written response, project, or discussion. This final task is a way to finalize the learning from the week-students can use their annotations from the text, details from the collaborative discussions they have had throughout the week, as well as feedback they have gotten from the teacher in order to construct a thorough and well constructed response to demonstrate understanding.Do you teach first grade?

"Kinder/FirstieSTEM Unit Five: States of Matter",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderFirstieSTEM-Unit-Five-States-of-Matter-3318427,"Kinder/FirstieSTEM Unit Five: States of Matter This packet is part of my Kinder/FirstieSTEM bundle. Save by purchasing the bundle HERE!Thanks so much for viewing my Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum unit. Kinder/FirstieSTEM Curriculum is an engaging STEM curriculum with young learners in mind! Kinder/FirstieSTEM is standards-based and encourages young learners to think “outside the box” and prove their thinking through hands-on and engaging learning experiences. What is STEM?STEM is the integration (not singular practice) of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math in an active environment that focuses on student-centered learning. Students are engaged in discovering problems, questioning, problem solving, collaborating, and hands on activities while they face real world issues. Students are encouraged to approach the problem based upon their previous learning. Everyone’s voice matters, all ideas matter and are discussed and attempted. Students evaluate their approach and solution throughout the STEM activity and improve their design as they build and experiment. Teachers are facilitators of thinking and guide students through the problem solving experience. An Overview of the Kinder/FirstieSTEM unit!Each unit is broken down into five to seven lessons. ** However, please note that each lesson can take several academic days to complete. Each lesson has the standards covered, materials list, lesson vocabulary, STEM design loop integration, detailed activity lesson plans, and all necessary student recording sheets. The units also includes vocabulary cards, parent unit overview letter, parent involvement request slips, STEM design loop, and all other necessary supplies. The lessons will at times suggest the integration of online book sources and online video databases to engage the learners into the unit topic. Please note that all student response sheets can be shrunk and placed into a student STEM journal. You can also choose to have students track their daily STEM activities in their STEM journal with or without the included response sheets.States of Matter- During this unit, the students will identify and experiment with the properties of solids, liquids, and gases. In addition, students will explore the various types of physical changes. The student engineers will use the knowledge they gained from this unit to create play dough.What About Standards?The units are based upon commonly phrases state science standards as well as the Next Generation Science Standards! Within the units you'll see those commonly used phrases of science power standards across state to state. Below are additional NGSS!Unit 5: K-2-ETS1-2. Develop a simple sketch, drawing, or physical model to illustrate how the shape of an object helps it functionas needed to solve a given problem.According to the U.S. Department of Education, all STEM jobs in the U.S. will increase 14 percent from 2010-2020, accounting for millions of positions. Yet many will go unfilled, as students are not prepared for an occupation in this field. We can change this, we must change this. Using a STEM approach in teaching allows students to apply learning that occurred in the four subject areas to a real life problem given by the teacher. Students are able to problem solve in a way that the typical classroom learning does not allow. STEM capitalizes on students’ interests and experiences, builds on what they know and have just learned, and provides them an opportunity to take chances and engage in learning in a different way. Using a STEM model prepares students to investigate questions they have about the world they live in and gives them the tools to solve daily problems they encounter. A STEM enriched classroom sounds different as well; students are conversing, sharing ideas, discussing possibilities, and using learned vocabulary as they experiment together. As educators, our job is to teach, create compelling learning environments that foster learning for our students, and prepare them to be college, career, and life ready. The use of vocabulary, hands on approach, and collaboration that occurs during these STEM lessons amazes me as a teacher. Some of my students who struggle with reading or math facts excel in STEM lessons. Their confidence builds as their team listens to their ideas; they feel valued and a part of the learning in a way they never have before. These students find new interests, strengths, and set new goals for their future. I learn more about my students while observing them solve problems in a STEM setting then I do in any other situation in the classroom. * * Be sure to view the preview for a look at the lesson plan set up!Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?

"Vowel Variants Science of Reading In-a-Click Lessons",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Vowel-Variants-Science-of-Reading-In-a-Click-Lessons-11249641,"The Science of Reading ""In-a-Click Lessons"" program, developed by Tara West at Little Minds at Work, is a comprehensive initiative centered around the science of reading, employing a systematic approach. The program follows a structured 6-step process for each activity, encompassing isolated sounds for learning, warm-up exercises with isolated words, word mapping, manipulation of sounds in words, encoding or writing words, and decoding phrases. GRAB THE MONEY SAVING BUNDLE HERE!Each set of 5 lesson plans includes a cohesive all-in-one page designed for students to read sounds, successively blend skill-based words, and engage in additional word blending. Following the warm-up on each page, students decode a skill-based passage to apply learning, with these passages strategically crafted over 5 days to facilitate fluency development. Implementation time for lessons may vary based on teaching style and can be adapted to various settings, such as standard classroom instruction, small-group sessions, tutoring, intervention programs, homeschooling, and volunteer-led sessions. The lessons are explicitly and systematically designed to ensure immediate success for all implementers. Pacing is flexible and contingent upon individual student progress, allowing for extended time in a lesson as needed. Ideally, each lesson should be repeated for two sessions, resulting in a 50-day unit of instruction. *Necessary supplies: whiteboard, marker, dry-erase sleeve, 4 manipulatives.*VIEW A DEMO/EXPLANATION VIDEO!Included Material:- 25 lesson plans (across 5 pages) Ideal instruction is 2 days per lesson, making this set 50 academic days- generic mapping mat- 5 all-in-one pages (sounds, word level decoding, and decodable passage)- 25 student practice pagesSound to Learn: State the sound orally.

"KinderHandwriting Curriculum Part Three: Sentences",N/A,"Tara West - Little Minds at Work",https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/KinderHandwriting-Curriculum-Part-Three-Sentences-3556699,"KinderHandwriting Curriculum Part Three: Sentences - - A systematic and comprehensive handwriting curriculum for the primary classroom.SAVE BIG by purchasing the KinderHandwriting B U N D L E!What is KinderHandwriting?KinderHandwriting is a systematic and versatile handwriting curriculum that can be used to supplement any current curriculum in the classroom! The program is designed to give primary students a way to practice and master writing words in a hands-on and meaningful way. You can find success in using this program in your whole-group instruction, intervention groups, RTI groups, guided reading, or as a resource for non-certified staff members assisting in the classroom. The program is based upon a slotted twenty minutes of instruction. However, this too is versatile as you can limit or extend this time frame to best fit your classroom needs. KinderHandwriting is created by a teacher for teachers. The program has been carefully created and organized to align with every classroom and curriculum. The words can be introduced in any order the teacher chooses. That makes this program available to all teachers that have the desire to boost their handwriting instruction.Tell me more about KinderHandwriting! KinderHandwriting offers two days of instruction per word. Each day the students will start the day’s lesson with whole-body movements. The teacher will then introduce the day’s word utilizing the included interactive path of motion slides. Students will then practice the word in a hands-on and meaningful way. Included are ten ideas for your hands-on handwriting bins. After the hands-on practice, students will apply their knowledge of the word by practicing the path of motion with a dry-erase marker and handwriting helper board. The handwriting helper is simply printed and placed into a dry erase sleeve. Lastly, students wrap up the day’s lesson by applying their knowledge of the word on a paper and pencil follow-up sheet. Why is handwriting instruction so important?Handwriting instruction in the primary classroom is not a new concept but it is one that can easily be pushed aside for the more prominent instruction of ELA and mathematics. However, handwriting is a core skill that every student should master. Handwriting is a complex skill engaging cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills simultaneously. It is best learned through direct instruction (Beringner, 2015; Berninger et al. 2006; Hanstra-Bletz and Blote, 1993; Maeland, 1992). KinderHandwriting recognizes the importance of handwriting instruction along with the complex processes that each letter contains. KinderHandwriting breaks down these complex words into achievable tasks, acceptable for all learners.What is included in KinderHandwriting Part Three?- 25 (2 day) lesson plans *a total of 50 instructional days- 25 interactive word letter math of motion files - Handwriting hands-on tubs overview sheet- 2 practice sheets per word- Word cards (2 versions)- Handwriting helper writing inserts What words and sentences are covered in KinderHandwriting Part Three?like- I like dogs.the- I like the cat.see- I see the sun.my- I see my mom.we- We like the rug.she- She is my mom.he- He likes cats.they- They like the bed.can- I can see the rat.you- Can you see me?want- I want a dog.do- I do not like it.have- I have a cat.that- Do you want that?is- That is my mom.look- Look at me play.make- I can make a hat.here- Here is my dad.are- Are you here?come- I want to come.with- Dad is with mom.down- I can go down.off- Can you jump off?be- I can be here.will- She will be here.Questions?Please email me at littlemindsatworkllc@gmail.comWould you like to receive notifications for my newly released packets and upcoming sale?
